Whether <a href=#>these friends are co-stars</a> or <a href=#>are fellow musicians</a>, they are always more interesting when they are famous and likable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal, both of whom are involved with <a href=#>Star Wars</a>, have a longstanding friendship that the internet cannot get enough of. Over time, we have learned a lot about these two.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at this amazing friendship.</p><h2 id=pedro-pascal-and-oscar-isaac-are-longtime-friends>Pedro Pascal And Oscar Isaac Are Longtime Friends</h2><p>Back in 2005, an off-Broadway production of The Beauty of the Father brought Pedro Pascal and Oscar Isaac together for the first time. This was long before the duo became major names in Hollywood, and at the time, they were looking to turn in quality performances to get their names out there.</p><p>When reflecting on this time, Isaac discussed what brought them together, and how they each had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an uphill battle to climb</a> in the business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It’s gotten better, but at that point, it was so easy to be pigeonholed in very specific roles because we’re Latinos. It’s like, how many gang member roles am I going to be sent," Isaac said.</p><p>"The dream was to be able to pay rent. There wasn’t a strategy. We were just struggling. It was talking about how to do this thing that we both love but seems kind of insurmountable," he continued.</p><p>Their similar upbringing also brought them together.</p><p>"We have very similar backgrounds. We're both children of Latin immigrants, so there's sort of a cultural familiarity, then at the same time we're both actors. We have the same dreams. It's something very special because it can be a lonely journey when you're out there going after — it sounds corny, but going after your dreams, and to find family along the way," Pascal said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As we have seen in the 17 years since that production, both Oscar Isaac and Pedro Pascal have been able to come major forces in the entertainment industry. Both have done exceptional work on the big and small screen, and at this point, they are considered legitimate stars.</p><p>They don't get to collaborate all the time, but the friends have been able to work together since that fateful production brought them together.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Call 'The Mandalorian' Star Pedro Pascal ‘Perfect Casting’ For HBO’s 'The Last Of Us'</a></span></p><h2 id=they-39-ve-done-great-work-together>They've Done Great Work Together</h2><p>In 2019, the bromance between Pedro Pascal and Oscar Isaac was taking social media by storm, and the duo got to work on the film Triple Frontier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring names like Ben Affleck and Charlie Hunnam, this major film brought the best friends together on the big screen, and fans were stoked to see them working alongside one another.</p><p>The film was a Netflix release, and it was able to gain some traction on the streaming platform.</p><p>So far, this remains of the biggest project that both men have worked on. While they have played characters in the same universe, they have not had the opportunity to share the screen with one another in some time. This, naturally, has people wondering if they will get the chance to work with one another in a major project.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pedro Pascal’s Sister Lux Comes Out As Trans And Fans Show Outpouring Of Love</a></span></p><h2 id=are-more-collabs-coming>Are More Collabs Coming?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this time, the duo is not set to work together on a project in the near future. This does not mean that it won't happen at some point, but it just means that as of right now, they are very much in their own lanes.</p><p>While they may not be working with one another, they have still had some fun giving interviews and discussing their friendship.</p><p>When speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a> earlier this year, Isaac joked about his relationship with Pascal.</p><p>"He's obsessed with me. I try to get away from him, he finds me. Even when I change my number... it's like a disease," he said.</p><p>Pascal, in his own interview with Esquire, hilariously fired back.</p><p>"I don't care to respond. Whatever makes him happy. I'll always be there for you, Oscar. Always."</p><p>Even when they aren't with one another, they still find a way to let their friendship shine through their words and actions. This is precisely why they have become such a hot topic on the Internet over the last few years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How 'Moon Knight' Star Oscar Isaac Made A Name For Himself In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>Again, Pedro Pascal an Oscar Isaac are not set to start anything together soon, but at some point, these two should make a buddy comedy together.
