But by February, it was reported the pair broke up. “Gigi and Leo are no longer dating,” <a href=#>an insider said at the time.</a> “Things just organically tapered off between them. Leo and Gigi were at different points in their life, and it just didn’t work out between the two of them.”</p><p>The same source claimed their relationship was “never serious.” “They both have incredibly busy careers and lives, and although they tried to make time for each other, it really wasn’t enough to make things work,” they explained.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, there was speculation that Gigi, 28, wanted something more serious than Leonardo, 48, who has a notorious reputation for dating younger women, especially <a href=#>since he was seen hanging out with other ladies amid their romance</a>.</p><h2 id=leonardo-amp-gigi-rsquo-s-romance-was-accused-of-being-a-publicity-stunt>Leonardo & Gigi’s Romance Was Accused Of Being A Publicity Stunt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/untitled-design-1.jpg><p>Interestingly, there’s been speculation from the beginning that Leonardo and Gigi’s relationship is all one big publicity stunt.</p><p>Before dating Gigi, the Titanic actor was dating model Camila Morrone for years, but broke up shortly after her 25th birthday. They led to a flurry of online jokes and memes, attributing Camila's age as the cause of their split (humorously suggesting she's now "too old" for him).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, Leo faced reproach for what was deemed unsettling behavior. It resurfaced that Leo initially met Camila when she was 11 years old, introduced to him through her stepfather, Al Pacino, leading him to face allegations of grooming the much younger model into his girlfriend.</p><p>This is the very reason people <a href=#>speculate that Leo's involvement with Gigi could be a big PR stunt</a>. The Victoria's Secret model is slightly older than the women Leo typically dates, as she's 28 years old.</p><p>Gigi is certainly not old, and she's widely regarded as one of the world's most stunning women. However, by pursuing a relationship with someone slightly older than his usual romantic choices, it's conceivable that Leonardo is aiming to mitigate the aftermath of his split with Camila by doing some damage control. This could also be why source claims the pair aren’t serious, yet they keep making headlines with their romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqeelr%2Blu4ydoJyZoKe2sHnGop6iZZiWsaqwjKucnKeemLatsYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmnqWjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
