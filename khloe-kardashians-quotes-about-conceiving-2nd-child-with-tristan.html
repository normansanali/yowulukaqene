But I didn’t know that was a lingering thing. … She said she would feel terrible putting [an embryo] in without warning me that most likely I wouldn’t be able to carry.”</p><p>The Los Angeles native was “shocked” by this news, explaining that she was simply “trying to … bring more love and more life into” her family.</p><p>The reality star previously <a href=#>clapped back at haters</a> after they negatively reacted to rumors that she was trying to have another child with the athlete.</p><p>“I don’t go on social media platforms much these days AND this is one of the main reasons why I stay away,” the Strong Looks Better Naked author tweeted in May 2020. “The sick and hurtful things people say. I am disgusted by so many things I am seeing. SMH people swear they know everything about me. Including my uterus. Sick.”</p><p>The Revenge Body host added at the time: “The nasty things you’re saying about me are over A RUMOR. I have seen so many hurtful/despicable stories and tweets about me over a false story. And if it were true. … it’s MY LIFE, NOT YOURS.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She and Thompson<a href=#> welcomed True in April 2018</a>.
