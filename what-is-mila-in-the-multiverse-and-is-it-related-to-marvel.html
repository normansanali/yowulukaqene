Mila can now travel back and forth between different parallel universes to look for her mother, Elis.

Since Elis found out that several universes actually exist in parallel, she has been hunted by a mysterious group called “Os Operadores.” Mila has to adjust to this new and extremely dangerous situation and receives support from her friends Juliana, Vinícius, and Pierre. Together with them, Mila travels the huge multiverse in search of her mother Elis. An unbelievable adventure full of surprises and dangers awaits the friends.”</p><h2 id=h-is-mila-in-the-multiverse-part-of-the-mcu data-injectable=false>Is Mila in the Multiverse part of the MCU?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=741 data-injectable=true>Nowadays, all anyone can think about when they see or hear the word “multiverse” is Marvel.
