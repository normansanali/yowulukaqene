Childan in The Man in the High Castle</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Started with the book and devoured as many times – so the book was the foundation of the character.&nbsp;There’s so much in the book that details Childan’s inner monologues and how he thinks about various situations and its conflicting aspects, so it was a very rich source.&nbsp;I was really lucky to be able to refer to that.</span></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The book was the starting point, and then I actually observed a few antique dealers in New York – sort of observed them and hung around their stores for a few days and observed the how they dealt with customers and basically managed the objects and antiques in their stores.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What was it like working with DJ Qualls and Rupert Evans?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;It was great.&nbsp;We are really close.&nbsp;We are very lucky on this show because we love each other so much because we are all in a strange town where none of us are residents except a few.&nbsp;A few of us are residents, but most of us don’t tour Canada, and there isn’t a big social group for us.&nbsp;We’re all really, really tight.&nbsp;It’s an amazing group of people.&nbsp;They’re really nice, and DJ and Rupert are just a joy to work with.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What was the dynamic with the directors?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;There’s a different director for each episode, so the dynamic changes depending on which director it is.&nbsp;But all of the directors who have been recruited for the series are pretty fantastic.&nbsp;It’s such a big show in terms of scope, that whoever directs an episode has a huge job to do just in terms of the scope of the storytelling and the time it takes to do it.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: Is it difficult to adapt to different types of scenarios in each episode?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;No.&nbsp;It’s something you get used to when you work in episodic television.&nbsp;I mean, it’s something you sort of get used to, very often.&nbsp;(When) a director comes in and gets hired to work on the show, they usually have a good idea of ​​what that show is and they want to contribute to it.&nbsp;So they are very aware of the general narrative of the season.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What were the most intense scenes to film?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Intensive?&nbsp;Emotionally or physically?&nbsp;I do not know.&nbsp;They’re all kind of – it’s funny.&nbsp;Sometimes a scene, if you’re watching as an audience member and you think ‘Oh, it’s just people sitting around a table talking’, that can be the hardest to shoot;&nbsp;because of its emotional underpinnings or simply the logistics of its technical shooting.&nbsp;You need to get huge coverage and lots of different angles, and it takes a lot of time.&nbsp;Each scene is stimulating in its own way.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What were some of the most memorable moments of your work on set?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;I don’t know.&nbsp;Let’s see.&nbsp;Well, Joel and I had a scene together, and we just made each other laugh the whole time, so we were laughing desperately while we rehearsed and then had to put it back together for the scene.&nbsp;I’ve known Joel de la Fuente for a long time, so it’s a bit dangerous to start working together because we’re giving each other a lot of trouble.&nbsp;The aforementioned dinner scene at Paul and Betty Kasoura was memorable to work on, simply because it was so difficult that way.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What emotional experiences did you draw from to portray your character?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;That’s a big question, you know?&nbsp;Think how to answer it.&nbsp;I mean, what I do – okay, I don’t want the actor to talk too much about it, but if I put myself in the imaginary circumstances of the scene, then hopefully the emotional reactions….</span></p><p><span>If I know what my character wants and am trying to get it, and I know what the stakes are, then I naturally behave in this scene according to those emotional goals.&nbsp;Although I don’t really rely on past experience, but insofar as I try to live fully in the present moment.&nbsp;Does that make sense?</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: Yes, that really makes sense.</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;I don’t really rely on anything in particular, like for a specific moment.&nbsp;In terms of character needs and customization, I mean, Childan desperately wants to belong.&nbsp;He wants to be loved.&nbsp;He wants to be appreciated.&nbsp;He is stuck in a society.&nbsp;You know, he’s trapped in a conquered society where he’ll never fit in, racially, and that’s interesting.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: What do you think of the possibility of simultaneous coexistence of alternate realities in our world, such as the fact that one dimension can affect the fate of another?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;I think that’s pretty cool.&nbsp;I think that’s a good idea.&nbsp;Obviously, a lot of theoretical physicists are quite enthusiastic about this in terms of the multiverse and also in terms of multidimensionality.&nbsp;I mean there are several dimensions.&nbsp;There are certainly more than the dimensions that we humans can see.&nbsp;When you get into quantum theory, things get really, really weird, and I’m always amazed at the idea of ​​interdimensional things happening.</span></p><p><strong><span>Q: Of course.&nbsp;Can you tell us what’s next for Bob Childan as he heads into the neutral zone, what’s next?</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Brennan Brown:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;I don’t know – season three is in development, so no, I have no idea.&nbsp;They just work hard, and we’ve had many meetings with writers and stuff, but it’s a little early to know the exact things/details.</span></p><p class=postsid
