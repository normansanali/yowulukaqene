Cardinal signs are Aries (fire), Capricorn (earth), Libra (air), and Cancer (fire).</p><p>Some signs in astrology are known as planetary signs, based on where the planet was in the sky at your birth. Cardinal signs are quality signs, meaning they can indicate your approach to life.</p><p>Not only are quality signs indicators of certain personality traits, but they coincide with different natural phenomena.
