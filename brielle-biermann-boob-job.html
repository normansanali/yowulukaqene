In fact, she looks so good, the photo is making fans wonder if she has gotten any work done on her breasts.&nbsp;</p><p>While the reality star has always been somewhat voluptuous, sporting a rather bodacious bod, her boobs happened to look larger than usual. Take a look and see for yourself, but proceed with caution — her beauty might ultimately blow you away. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It's Transformation Friday up in here, y'all.</h2><p>For a little additional frame of reference, here&nbsp;is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a photo of Brielle from 2016</a> from her Instagram... you can make your own judgment call regarding any differences you may notice.</p><p>Obviously, nothing is confirmed regarding this matter, and the reality star continues to deny ever having work done. But either way, Brielle is looking seriously amazing, and what she decides to do with her body is entirely up to her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brielle Biermann wants everyone to know it's not anyone's business but her own if she got a boob job.</h2><p>In the past, when followers have made comments to Brielle in an attempt to spark plastic surgery rumors, she has (understandably) put them on blast publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>You tell 'em, Brielle. Your body, your choice. Yaaaas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brielle is continuing to make a name for herself as an influencer.</h2><p>She actually happens to be a social media kween, ladies and gents. Boasting over one million followers, and snagging brand deals with FabFitFun, 310 Shake, and more, Brielle is totally slaying the game on each of her social media platforms.</p><p>And if you haven't already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">checked out her Instagram</a>, it boasts a wide variety of content, including model shots, candid photos, and snaps with friends and family.</p><p>Plus, she has joined forces with her mom and sister Arianna to start their own business. Yes, you heard that correctly — the Biermann ladies have officially launched their own makeup line earlier this year, which they've dubbed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KAB Cosmetics</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Biermann ladies, keep up the good work!</p><p>Maybe Brielle did — in fact —&nbsp;get a&nbsp;boob job, or maybe she just happens to look extra fabulous today. Either way, there is seriously no denying the bodacious blonde is continuing to turn heads like the gorgeous goddess she is until the end of time.</p><p>Keep on slaying Brielle, you look seriously amazing.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BqsculnGaamZq%2Frq3Np2Sbp5%2BXequ7wQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
