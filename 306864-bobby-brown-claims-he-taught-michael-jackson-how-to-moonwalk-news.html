The New Edition star has often shred tales about his experiences in the music industry, and&nbsp;some aren't PG-13. However, one memory he continues to share is that of his time with late music icon Michael Jackson. Brown recently chatted with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fat Joe</a> on Instagram Live and during their conversation, Bobby Brown doubled down on his claims that he taught the King of Pop how to do his signature moonwalk dance step.</p><p>Astrid Stawiarz / Stringer / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm letting you know that this is what happened. This is how<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> the moonwalk was formed,</a>" Brown began. Fat Joe couldn't contain himself and began screaming. Brown continued, "He perfected it, but I taught him how to do it. We can bring Ralph Tresvant, [Bel Biv DeVoe], all on, they were all there. We were in the foyer."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Michael Jackson debuted the moonwalk in 1983 at a Jackson anniversary show, and years later in an interview with&nbsp;Time,&nbsp;Shalamar's&nbsp;Jeffrey Daniel said he was the person who taught M.J. the move. Yet, Brown has shared his version in the past, including during a 2017 interview with&nbsp;The Cypher where he stated that the moonwalk was "one of my signature moves."&nbsp;Previously, Brown also claimed that New Edition was responsible for the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Just Say No" anti-drug campaign</a>&nbsp;but never received credit.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
