The dynamic cast reunited for another trip, this time to Las Vegas.

She wants to come to Vegas,” <strong>Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi</strong> tells the group in the new trailer. <strong>Jenni “JWoww” Farley</strong> does not seem amused and actually gets annoyed with Nicole for even meeting up with her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Jersey-Shore-Family-Vacation.jpg><p>Angelina, 31, didn’t get along with most of the cast during the original series but did return for the first season of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation in Miami. She <a href=#>seemed to patch things up with the gang</a>, but that doesn’t mean the cast is ready to take her in with open arms.</p><p>“I wanted to go and make amends because I really thought that there was a lot of unfinished business with me and the cast and the roommates,” the EMT told Us in May about why she wanted to enter the house again. “I just felt like there was a lot on my chest that I needed to get off, and it was eating up and away at me for all those years.”</p><p>The trailer also features some big moments for the rest of the cast, including <a href=#><strong>Deena Cortese</strong></a> announcing she’s pregnant, <a href=#><strong>Paul “DJ Pauly D” DelVecchio</strong></a> seemingly getting married (to <a href=#><strong>Vinny Guadagnino</strong></a>?), and someone mooning the group.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve said this before and I’m gonna say it again.
