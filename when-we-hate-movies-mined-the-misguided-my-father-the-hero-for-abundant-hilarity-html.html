The gents of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>We Hate Movies </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>describe the movie, without hyperbole, as “fantastically creepy.” They then proceed to unpack the layers of that fantastical creepiness.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4czjmcb35kvlm1@published data-word-count=67><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>is like a Russian nesting doll of wrongness. It’s one criminally-off idea nestled inside another, beginning with the epic miscasting of sausage-fingered heavyweight actor Gerard Depardieu as a rascally single dad and a precociously insufferable Katherine Heigl as his 14-year-old daughter (fourteen!), who the podcast accurately deems both “trash” and a “sociopath” and unusually unlikable even for a character played by Katherine Heigl.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4dzjmc5nw5br3n@published data-word-count=165><span style=font-weight:400>Heigl’s character, you see, wants to impress some garbagey teenaged dude at the romantic vacation resort Depardieu takes her to, so she pretends that her father is actually her brutish, much-older lover. This leads to the entire resort thinking that Depardieu is enjoying a vigorous sex life with a woman who looks like his 14-year-old daughter because she </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>is </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>his 14-year-old-daughter. Making things much worse: while we constantly have balding 34-year-olds play high school-age characters (on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Beverly Hills 90210, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>of course, but elsewhere too), </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>aimed unwisely for realism and verisimilitude and cast an actress roughly the same age (that is, way too young!) as the 14-year-old she’s playing. </span><span style=font-weight:400>This leads, among other hijinks, to Depardieu mortifying a crowd convinced he’s at worst a pedophile and at best a man with a sexual hunger for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>very </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>young girls with a rousing, repellent cover of Jacques Brel’s “Thank Heaven for Little Girls,” which, mortifyingly enough, provokes riotous laughter, albeit of the unintentional variety.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4ezjmcomhphqzr@published data-word-count=90><span style=font-weight:400>Everything about the ill-fated 1994 comedy is wrong on both a micro and a macro level. As a subject for podcast comedy, it’s a gift that keeps on giving, a movie that begins on a spectacularly off note and just keeps veering further and further off course. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>We Hate Movies </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>gets a lot out of the movie itself, but some of the podcast’s funniest and most memorable moments are digressions involving a comedy roast of King Kong and a proposed vehicle for Ray Winstone and Gerard Depardieu called </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fat Spies.</span></i></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4fzjmclbubccja@published data-word-count=135><span style=font-weight:400>I spent much of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>mentally admonishing star Katherine Heigl to cover up and not promenade in public in a thong as a 14-year-old. Fourteen! Where were her parents? Oh, won’t </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>someone </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>think of the children, even if the child in question is a disturbingly over-sexualized, jailbait Katherine Heigl?&nbsp;</span><span style=font-weight:400>So it was reassuring to know that I’m not the only one appalled by what the podcast refers to as the “thong scene” and its repugnant over-sexualization of an actress who was, at the time of the movie’s filming, essentially a child. That’s why </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>is the rare film that can be found in both the “light vacation comedies” and “softcore child porn” section alongside </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Blame It on Rio, </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>which the discriminating gents here deem the “nuclear bomb of child-fucking movies.”</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4gzjmcmcj6345b@published data-word-count=66><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>can really only be understood as a French export. Indeed, Depardieu had starred in a French-language version of this same story three years earlier. But where French audiences proved sophisticated enough to chuckle at comical misunderstandings involving a 14-year-old girl pretending her father is actually her lover, stateside audiences looked askance at consuming light entertainment rooted in gags about pedophilia and incest.</span></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgz3uh7x0q4hzjmcir56wind@published data-word-count=59><span style=font-weight:400>Well, most Americans looked askance at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>My Father the Hero </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and its peculiar brand of “family” comedy.
