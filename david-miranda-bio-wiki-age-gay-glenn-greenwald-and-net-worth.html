He met with Luciana Genro, the PSOL candidate for the 2014 Brazilian presidential election, and obtained her commitment to extend Snowden’s asylum if elected. Numerous public Brazilian figures supported the campaign, which however failed to swing the government of Dilma Rousseff.</p><p>In August 2013, Miranda was detained over his work on the NSA program for nine hours by the British government at London’s Heathrow Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, after he had flown in from Berlin and was changing to a plane bound for home, in Rio de Janeiro. His belongings were seized, including an external hard drive said to contain sensitive documents relevant to Greenwald’s reporting, which was encrypted with TrueCrypt encryption software.</p><p>Greenwald described his partner’s detention as “clearly intended to send a message of intimidation to those of us who have been reporting on the NSA and GCHQ”.&nbsp; Miranda himself has described his treatment under UK authorities as “psychological torture”. In 2014, for an article by Greenwald in The Intercept, Miranda interviewed Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, and then a little known representative.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-david-miranda></span><span>Frequently Asked Questions About David Miranda</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-david-miranda></span><span>Who is David Miranda?</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Miranda is a&nbsp;Brazilian politician.
