Also, you gotta have sex — men need it, and it’s important for the relationship. It doesn’t have to be all the time, but you have to get it in there sometimes!”</p><p>The mother of two (soon-to-be three!) added that she and her husband, Chicago Bears player <strong><a href=#>Jay Cutler</a></strong>, also make sure to each take time for themselves and their endeavors while the other watches the kids.</p><p>“During football season, I don’t work very much, so I can be home and focus on taking care of the boys,” she wrote. “But during Jay’s off-season, we swap roles, and he stays home with the boys while I focus on work and do any necessary traveling. It’s just worked out this way timing-wise, which has been amazing.”</p><p>Cavallari, 28, and Cutler, 32, <a href=#>announced via the former reality star’s app</a> in May that they are expecting their third child together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’re at it again! Thrilled to announce baby number 3 is on the way!” she wrote at the time. “The cutler crew just keeps on growin’!”</p><p>The pair are already parents to two sons — <strong>Camden</strong>, 2, and <strong>Jaxon</strong>, 12 months, and their third will be a girl.</p><p>“We picked out this baby girl’s name when I was pregnant with our first,” she explained on the blog. “I met a woman and her dog, and I loved her dog’s name. Funny enough, it was the name she had picked out if she had a girl, but she had boys, so she used it for her dog instead. Here we are 3.5 years later, and we are going to use that name for our little girl!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYysn5qqlah6qbHRZqqem6KawW7AzmakmqqZqa6teceap6mhnprAtHnSnq9mamBmgnN%2FmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
