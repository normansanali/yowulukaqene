As we know, 76-year-old Pat Sajak is the long-time host of Wheel of Fortune, a position held since 1981. Over the years, Sajak has received 19 nominations for the&nbsp;Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host, winning three times. But what about his daughter? Did she inherit her father’s natural born talent as an entertainer?</p>Recommended Videos<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=844 data-injectable=true>In some ways, yes. Although Maggie isn’t a renowned game show host like Pat, she’s a successful country musician. She began her career in 2011 with her single “First Kiss,” which appeared on the Jan. 3, 2012, episode of&nbsp;Wheel of Fortune, marking her 17th birthday a few days later. Although her passion lies in music, Sajak did follow in her father’s footsteps to take over for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vanna White</a> as co-host on Wheel for a week in January 2020. This was due to Pat Sajak undergoing surgery and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">White stepping in</a> as host.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>In the same vein, she filled in for Vanna White for a&nbsp;Celebrity Wheel of Fortune&nbsp;episode in May 2013, in which White was a contestant herself. Aside from co-hosting and songwriting, Sajak began playing guitar at the age of 12, and began her freshman year at Princeton University in 2013. Around the same time, she also did a fashion shoot for Teen Vogue, so there’s no denying the camera loves her, be it live television or photography.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=243 data-injectable=false>The 28-year-old singer hasn’t released any new music since 2013, and with the announcement that Ryan Seacrest will be replacing Pat Sajak for Wheel of Fortune, it doesn’t look like she’ll be sticking around to co-host either.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmpZGctKqxjKyYo5mbYq6vsIywn7Jlmah6tLTEZp2apZ%2BqwG6ty6VkmpqfqsFuw8eenKVln5t6p7vRraynnV2dvLTAjKmYrWWjlreit9Jmm5qtl53Bpr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
