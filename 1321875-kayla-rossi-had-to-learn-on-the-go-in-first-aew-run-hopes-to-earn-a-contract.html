We were actually sponsored by the same supplement company. He has seen a little bit about what I can do. I’m a former gymnast, I’m a pro bodybuilder and was always just messing around on <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, throwing tricks and gymnastics and stuff. He was like, you should just get in the ring with me one time. So I was like okay, bet. So we did this little video, just running ropes,” she said. “He taught me how to bump and stuff, and I posted it on Instagram.</p><p>“I got hit up by a recruiter and also by QT Marshall, who ran The Nightmare Factory. So it was super random, he was like, ‘Listen, I wanna sponsor you for one of the Nightmare Factory camps.’ This was two weeks before it started, so in two weeks, I decided to just pack up my shit, get in my car, and drive to Atlanta. That’s kind of where it all started,” Rossi explained, “coming no experience, nothing, just decided to move down to Atlanta and give it a shot.”</p><p>Rossi noted that it was funny because her family members and friends would tell her she should be a pro wrestler, so it felt like an easy transition in some ways. Rossi then explained that Marshall was the one that presented the gig with Joey Janela on AEW programming and joked that she was thrown into the deep end right away.</p><p>“It was about six or seven weeks into the camp, and he sent me a text. He was like, ‘I have a job for you.’ I was like what? I was like, what do you mean you have a job [for me]? He was like, yeah, Joey Janela needs a manager or a bodyguard kind of thing, and he thinks that you’d be perfect for it. So the next week,” she explained, “I flew out to TV and a little part, like jumped into the ring, powerbombed someone, and that was kind of my start with that. So yeah, I was just kind of thrown to the wolves [laughs] and then learn as you go kind of thing.”</p><p>Rossi was asked about her future with AEW and if the customary “All Elite” graphic was in the works.</p><p>“We’ll see. We’ll see,” Rossi said. “It’s up in the air, so we will see what happens. But that’s the goal.”</p><p>Rossi first appeared in All Elite Wrestling in 2021 as the manager for Joey Janela, but quietly departed the company earlier this year. In May,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Fightful Select</a> reported that Rossi was offered a trainee contract but she turned it down. That led to the two sides parting ways, but it was said to be an amicable split.</p><p>Since then, Rossi has returned to AEW as an in-ring competitor, as she made her first appearance on the August 16 episode of AEW Dark against&nbsp;Avery Breaux.&nbsp;Rossi also competed on the <a href=# rel=noopener>August 30 episode of AEW Dark</a> against Vipress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJraHFvZWK4osXLmmSrp6Ootm60wJ1kraddobKivs1mpqdlpJ2ybrPOZqCnZZaev7TAjJqcsGWiqrtutM6pnKxlpKR6pq3Rp2SaZZOku7W%2BwJyr</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
