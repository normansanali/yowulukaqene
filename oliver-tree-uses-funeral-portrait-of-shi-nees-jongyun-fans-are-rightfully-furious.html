The world witnessed bits of funeral ceremony that was broadcast then, as the members of the group looked vulnerable and heartbroken by the huge loss.</p><p>Fans of the group, <a href=# rel>Shawols</a> are also just as distraught by the memory of that funeral day. The members and the fans always want to keep SHINee's Jonghyun in their hearts and minds through their happy memories with him. When such sensitive issues are messed with on social media, it is but natural for fans to get enraged. Shawols noticed that American singer, Oliver Tree had used the funeral portrait of SHINee's Jonghyun as a joke to promote his upcoming album and this resulted in them getting enraged.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>SHINee's Taemin looks healthy in interview from military, fans say 'eat all you want'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>#HappyKeyDay: SHINee Key's fans donate $11K to charity on idol's 31st birthday</a></p><h2 class=split>Oliver Tree gets backlash over insensitive post</h2><p>On October 10, Oliver Tree posted a photoshopped picture on his YouTube feed with the caption, "Rest in peace sweet bowl cut." Fans of SHINee noticed that the funeral portrait used for the post was that of SHINee's member <a href=# rel>Jonghyun,</a> who died by <a href=# rel>suicide</a> on December 18, 2017. Enraged fans started posting on social media platforms regarding how he was being insensitive and used a serious issue that left them shattered for years together.</p><p>Since the issue blew up and "#Apology_OliverTree" started trending on Twitter, Oliver Tree took to his official Instagram account to explain the situation. In what was a story that disappeared in 24 hours, Oliver said that he was not aware of the source of the original photo. He said that the photoshopped edit with his face in the funeral portrait was posted on his account a long time ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9959cd28-eb4b-4548-b4b1-9067ad771f45.jpeg><h2 class=split>'A foolish mistake'</h2><p>In the apology, Oliver Tree said that due to lack of research in terms of the original source of the photo, he had committed a foolish mistake. He said that when he made the post he or his team did not know where the post was from and his intentions were not malicious. Since he posted the photo, he said that he had realized the gravity of posting sensitive images.</p><p>After an apology that shows no remorse or regret from the singer, Oliver Tree went on to explain his reason for using that picture which made Shawols further upset as it did not really sound genuine but looked like a petty excuse. Oliver said that his upcoming album and tour were going to be about death as his cousin had passed away when he was in middle school.&nbsp;</p><p>He then concluded the said apology by saying that fans of Jonghyun should, "understand it was not intentional," as he sent his condolences to Jonghyun's family and fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/a712a5f6-c3ea-4bfc-afb4-eef9b4f6e672.jpeg><h2 class=split>'The disrespect can't be forgiven'</h2><p>Fans of Jonghyun believe that Oliver Tree is trying to justify his wrongdoings as he has been called out by fans publicly. One fan said, "The disrespect cannot be forgiven so easily. You only care because there is backlash. This is something that should not have happened at all. If you are telling the story of a personal experience, use your own photos. This is disgusting." Another fan said, "Tw // dec18. This is the second time this year a youtuber is using his funeral pictures inappropriately. in what sense do you think making memes out of someones funeral is funny?? apologize properly. we need a sincere apology."</p><p>One fan asked for others to join them in voicing their anger as they posed their distraught thoughts saying, "Please be angry with me. Please make a voice with me." One fan questioned, "I&nbsp;feel sick. I just don‚Äôt understand how anybody can be so...idek the word for it... insensitive? stupid? Why would you do something like that? How the hell did you think that was a good idea? I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real." One fan was angry that Oliver Tree made himself the victim in this situation and said, "I‚Äôm?? people who make an apology because of a disgusting mistake attempt to justify themselves with all the extra fluff like ‚Äúoh i lost someone too and so‚Ä¶‚Äù everyone‚Äôs gone through shit in life but at least most think before they post." One angry fan asked, "Oh yeah? Then why not use your cousin's picture?"</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The disrespect cannot be forgiven so easily. You only care because there is backlash.
