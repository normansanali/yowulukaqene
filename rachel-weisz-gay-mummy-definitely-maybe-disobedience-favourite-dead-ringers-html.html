Her magnificent face, visceral intelligence, and fierce self-possession meant that in her early films, Weisz often played the unattainable object of some undeserving straight man’s yearning: Think of Hugh Grant pretending to have an entire son just to seduce her in About a Boy, ex-con Alessandro Nivola stalking her in I Want You, Paul Rudd donating himself to her as an experiment in heterosexuality in The Shape of Things. In the early aughts, she played the hot, brilliant dead wife to both Ralph Fiennes (The Constant Gardener) and <a href=#>Hugh Jackman (The Fountain</a>), who both bent time and space to get back to her and ultimately destroyed themselves in her name, which is completely reasonable but not quite gay enough.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgqugrmi003r3b6v3u93j1u6@published data-word-count=110>But in the last decade or so, Weisz has, mercifully, launched herself directly into the lesbian sun. She’s topped the queen of England in The Favourite, spit in Rachel McAdams’s mouth in Disobedience, and in her latest and gayest work yet, sensuously bitten her own neck in an overt suggestion of <a href=#>Rachel Weisz</a>–on–<a href=#>Rachel Weisz </a>action in the new Amazon series <a href=#>Dead Ringers</a>. In the process, she’s become an object of extreme <a href=#>lesbian</a> thirst who has been a root for at least 8 million queer women. All of it is a miracle, but none of it is an accident: Back in 2009, Weisz expressed her desire to be a<a href=#> “lesbian icon</a>.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clgqugrmk003s3b6vsnmcppbo@published data-word-count=67>But Weisz’s movies have always been kind of gay, going as far back as The Mummy, a movie about a chaotically hot librarian who believes in reincarnation, and Definitely, Maybe, which is ostensibly a Ryan Reynolds–led rom-com for straight people but is more subtly about Rachel Weisz being a bisexual journalist who loves show tunes.
