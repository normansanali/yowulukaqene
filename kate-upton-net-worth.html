I'm not here to be used.</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>2</td><td>[on being religious] I was at a photo shoot and I was wearing a cross necklace that my mom bought me, and somebody made a joke like "Why are you wearing a cross? Like you would be religious." And then they took it away. I was really affected by that. The whole thing made me realize that I do want a cross with me, at all times.</td></tr><tr readability=12><td>3</td><td>I just think that pick-up lines in general are horrible. None of them work. I just want to say, "Ah, that was really cheesy," and walk away [...] I would've been like "Oh my gosh, don't touch me!". But then there's a balance. Like this one guy was trying to be funny - he was very direct and said, "Listen, let's be friends with benefits."
