Aside from designing, he also photographed for Chanel and was published in magazines including British Vogue and Interview.</p><p>Some of Lagerfeld’s most famous styles include the multi-layered pearl necklace, a hula-hoop bag for Chanel in Spring 2013, a blow-up skirt for his Spring 1993 line and Chanel mini bikinis.</p><p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibit will highlight Lagerfeld’s signature work, including his iconic fashion from the 1950s through his final collection in 2019. Over <a href=#>150 garments will be on display</a>, including his original sketches, showing his creative process and collaborative relationship with a head seamstress. There will also be a room dedicated to the seamstresses, who made his imagination come to life.</p><p>Met Director <strong>Max Hollein</strong> <a href=#>revealed that the exhibit</a> “will unpack his singular artistic practice, inviting the public to experience an essential part of Lagerfeld’s boundless imagination and passion for innovation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/What-is-the-Theme-of-Met-Gala-2023-Karl-Lagerfeld-A-Line-of-Beauty-Explained-02.jpg><p>One of Lagerfeld’s most beloved gowns came in Spring 2017 for Chanel’s Haute Couture show.
