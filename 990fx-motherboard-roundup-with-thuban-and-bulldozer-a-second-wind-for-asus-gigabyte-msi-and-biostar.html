Button, which allows the board to recover from failed memory overclocks that fail to get through the initial POST screen by setting defaults.&nbsp; Further down, below the 24-pin ATX connector is a USB 3.0 header.&nbsp; The position of this (and one of the 4-pin chassis headers) is a little odd – if the user has a very beefy GPU in the first slot which has a large (>4mm) back plate, it could possibly intrude into the USB header, making it rather annoying.&nbsp; I see a current trend to put USB 3.0 headers at right angles like the SATA ports, for dedicated USB 3.0 front panel support – perhaps this will occur on later models, depending on the design philosophy.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5714/SabertoothOblique_575px.JPG style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>While the chipset heatsink does not look like it will remove a lot of heat (very few fins), it does look pretty substantial in terms of bulk.&nbsp; The SATA ports are beside this, with two SATA 3 Gbps from a JMicron JMB362 controller in black, and the six SATA 6 Gbps ports from the chipset below. &nbsp; The bottom of the board is standard – a trio of USB 2.0 headers, a COM port, front panel audio and front panel connectors.</p><p>For PCIe layout, we have a design that rather than maximize the number of GPUs available, tries to make sure that there is enough airflow.&nbsp; So from the top, we have an x16, x1, x4, x16, PCI, x8.&nbsp; This means that there is plenty of space for a trio of GPUs (the second x16 will reduce to x8 if a card is in the x8 slot) and an x4 card.&nbsp; But the common usage will be in dual GPU mode, which leaves a one slot gap between cards (unlike the Gigabyte board later).</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5714/SABERTOOTHIO_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The IO back panel is representative of a 9-series board at $185, though personally there could be score for improvement.&nbsp; We have a combination PS/2 port, eight USB 2.0 ports in black, two more USB 2.0 ports in red, two USB 3.0 ports in blue, an IEEE1394 port, a Power eSATA 3 Gbps port, a standard eSATA 3 Gbps, optical SPDIF output, Realtek 8111E gigabit Ethernet, and standard audio headers. &nbsp;&nbsp;Personally it could have been arranged a little nicer – it does look a bit of an up-and-down skyscraper landscape.&nbsp; There is space for another Ethernet port, and I have a feeling that Sabertooth users might be interested in another one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ4fZNocHJolq16rrvToZyrmp%2BWv6V50aisp5ylpXq4tdOhZK2gpZeur3nAp5tmmqWhuaW72Z6pZpldqLKku82dZLChnpl6p7vRZpisraNitKqzwJuwrZ1dosCqecCnm2aamaTAta3RaGw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
