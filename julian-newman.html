He used to play for the middle school squad after starting at Downey Christian High School in 2012. He had rapid success and was capable of hitting 91 points in a game. As a result, he was elevated to the school’s varsity team. He averaged 2.4 points, 11 assists, and 4.3 steals per game in his first three games. Downey Christian had a 21-6 point record thanks to Newman while leading the state of Florida in assists.</p><p>On the 19th of December, 2012, he received a promotion to the next class, and his average score increased to 17 points per game. He was featured in a story titled “Fifth-grader starting for Florida varsity team” on the website MaxPreps. His highlight video, which was shared on YouTube by ScoutsFocus, went viral and has over 3.5 million views. The fact that Newman was only in fifth grade when he made the varsity team drew global news, notably in The New York Times and Sports Illustrated. He began making television appearances on shows such as Steve Harvey, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Good Morning America, and others.</p><h2><span id=Fame>Fame</span></h2><p>He was rewarded by being invited to sing during halftime at an Orlando Magic NBA game. In December 2013, The Huffington Post dubbed him “The Best Sixth Grade Basketball Player You’ve Ever Seen.” He averaged 13.6 points and 10.5 assists per game during that time. The Tampa Bay Times dubbed him “the world’s most promoted 12-year-old basketball player” the following year. While his game and rankings were praised, several media sites had polarized viewpoints and criticized the headlines by comparing him to a child star.</p><p>He set a record as the youngest player to amass 1000 career varsity points in seventh grade. After the 2014-15 season, he averaged 19.8 points, 10.2 assists, and 3.2 steals per game. Julian started starring in his documentary series, “Born Ready,” which was posted to YouTube by Elite Mixtapes in 2015. On the 4th of October, 2016, he scored 52 points in a widely publicized match-up with top 2020 class recruit Kyree Walker at the Middle School Hoops TV camp.
