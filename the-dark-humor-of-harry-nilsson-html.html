The album title and cover are perfect illustrations of the humor and apathy that encompassed Nilsson’s musical career.&nbsp;Noel Murray of the A.V. Club&nbsp;<a href=#>wrote</a>&nbsp;of Nilsson: “Nilsson became the musician’s musician, admired for his wild arrangements, his insistence on satisfying his own muse before making his record label happy, and his willingness to mock himself, the culture, and every notion of showbiz propriety.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kazq484h3fe94z1@published data-word-count=61>Harry Nilsson liked nonsense. Though two of his most famous tracks, “Everybody’s Talkin” and “Without You,” are somber in tone, they aren’t emblematic of his career nor are they songs he wrote. It’s not that Nilsson didn’t compose heartfelt songs, but so much of what actually represents Harry Nilsson is the nonsense, the humor, the randomness in his writing and performing.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb0q484o9uxq5hw@published data-word-count=51>Nilsson was famously close with John Lennon, Ringo Starr, The Monkees, and various other mainstream musicians of the ‘60s and ‘70s. But he never became the household name his contemporaries did—likely because of his erratic lifestyle (see his&nbsp;<a href=#>Lost Weekend</a>&nbsp;with John Lennon) and increasing refusal to do something simply for commercial accessibility.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb1q4840xp9rs47@published data-word-count=69>One constant in Nilsson’s music was his humor – the subtle deadpan,&nbsp;blatant&nbsp;belligerence, and random wordplay in his records. His comedy may not have rivaled a Carlin or Pryor standup set, but for someone as proficient in music as Nilsson, it was a useful weapon in his arsenal. Musicians like Nilsson, Warren Zevon, and Randy Newman used satire and irony to assuage their somber side – like good&nbsp;comic relief&nbsp;in drama.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb2q4848mo65a4o@published data-word-count=42>Nilsson could write a song about his father abandoning him as a child (“1941”); he could capture the sorrow of isolation (“One”) and he could make a musical comedy called the&nbsp;<a href=#>Son of Dracula</a>&nbsp;starring himself as Count Downe and Ringo Starr as Merlin.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb3q484fevbfr0z@published data-word-count=28>There are&nbsp;<a href=#>plenty of songs</a>&nbsp;and outtakes from Nilsson’s career worth giving a listen. &nbsp;Here are some of the comedic compositions that make Nilsson such a standout of his era:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb4q484xxs9dbf5@published data-word-count=3><b>Good Old Desk</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb5q484ipbqgg0k@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb6q484zq8smaez@published data-word-count=58>“Good Old Desk” has a whimsical melody and the subject matter is light; the narrator&nbsp;considers his desk a reliable companion, there for him 9-5 to keep his “hopes alive.” He really loves this desk, so much that the song ends with the narrator opening one of the drawers and&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;picture of him working at that same beloved desk.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb7q484tzmnd84n@published data-word-count=23>Like many comedians, Nilsson inserted his beliefs in his humor. He discussed the meaning of the song when he appeared on&nbsp;<a href=#>Playboy After Dark</a>:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb8q48459jk97co@published data-word-count=62>“It’s not really so much about a desk as it is an anagram game.” Nilsson told Hugh Hefner it had to with man’s modern concept of a higher power. Good Old Desk = G.O.D. Nilsson later claimed he was kidding about this reference, but his fans and contemporaries believe this was Nilsson’s way of grappling with the concept of a higher power.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kb9q484m639oaa8@published data-word-count=2><b>The Point!</b></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kbaq484d4hmqtce@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kbbq4847cm8c7d6@published data-word-count=35>Nilsson devoted an entire album to a pun. <i>The Point!</i>&nbsp;is either completely&nbsp;nonsensical, a random story about people with points on their heads or it’s an existentialist statement on how society judges each other and themselves.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjgzeilkg0kbcq48435ul6sq4@published data-word-count=60>The album tells the story of a&nbsp;town, the Land of Point, in which everything, the people, the animals, the objects all have a literal point coming out of them.

It sounds like a country standard with Nilsson tweaks. It’s not an inherently funny to song to start, except that he’s mocking and paying homage to the country genre simultaneously.
