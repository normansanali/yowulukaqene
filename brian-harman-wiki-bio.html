His father Eric Harman does not seem to be a fan of golf. Nonetheless, he attended Brian’s master debut in 2015 and watched the tournament played by his son. Brian’s father, Eric, also admitted that he would not have attended a gold tournament if his son was not playing on it. Harman’s mother, Nancy, is a chemist by profession. Nancy seems to be very much interested in Brian’s career as a professional career.</p><p>She is seen cheering for her son on several occasions and has also supported her son. However, much about her personal life has not come to the surface yet. Despite attending several tournaments watching her son play and lift the trophy, Nancy has somehow managed to keep herself away from the spotlight and media coverage. Further moving on to his relationship, Brian Harman is married to his wife, Kelly Van Slyke. The couple has a child named Cooper Marie. The Harman family lives in their home on Sea Island in Georgia. Speaking of Brian’s education, he went to the University of Georgia to complete his graduation.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.golfchannel.com/sites/default/files/2022/11/19/harman_1920_rsm22_D3_chip.jpg alt="Ending the Sea Island Mafia's RSM Classic drought now falls on Brian Harman | Golf Channel" width=814 height=458 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Harmans_Relationship_with_Butch_Harmon></span>Brian Harman’s Relationship with Butch Harmon<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Brian Harman and Butch Harmon are not related. They have their last name different as well; Brian is Harman and Butch is Harmon. Butch Harmon was the son of famous golfer Claude “Butch” Harmon Sr. Although he is also a well-known golf instructor from the United States of America, he does not share any family relationships with Brian Harman. Butch has been working as a professional golf instructor for a very long time now. Harmon has two brothers, Craig and Bill Harmon. They are also well-established golf instructors.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Harman_Professional_Career></span>Brian Harman Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In college, Harman was a three-time 2nd Team All-American on the University of Georgia golf team. He won the 2005 NCAA Preview and the 2006 Isleworth Invitational. In 2003, Harman won the U.S. Junior Amateur. He won the Players Amateur in 2005, and the Porter Cup in 2007. In 2010, Harman played mostly on the EGolf Professional Tour finishing in the top 10 in 11 of his 14 starts. He also played in three Nationwide Tour events in 2010. Harman was known for a unique situation at the 2012 Players Championship.</p><p>Harman later qualified for his first major, the 2012 U.S. Open. His first PGA Tour win was the 2014 John Deere Classic. On August 30, 2015, at The Barclays at Plainfield Country Club in Edison, New Jersey, Harman became the third player in PGA Tour history to have two aces in the same round. On May 7, 2017, Harman won the Wells Fargo Championship held at Eagle Point Golf Club in Wilmington, North Carolina, for his second PGA Tour win.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Brian Harman (@harmanbrian)</a></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Harmans_Net_worth></span>Brian Harman’s Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As of 2021, Harman has a net worth of $9 million accrued mainly from his activities as a professional golfer. Likewise, the 34-year-old has been involved in the sport for over a decade. Added to that, golf is probably the most lucrative sport in the market. Thus, his massive net worth should come as no surprise. Regarding salaries, professional golfers do not earn a fixed salary because they don’t work or play for any organization. Instead, they have to depend on their cash prize from each tournament.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1024,h_576,x_0,y_77/c_fill,w_720,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theduel_en_international_web/01g7wq2nppttaac0xh7t.jpg alt="Brian Harman Open Championship 2022 Odds, History, Predictions & How to Watch" width=799 height=449 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Harman_Wiki_Bio_Age_Height_Career></span>Brian Harman Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table><tbody><tr><td width=250>Full name</td><td width=251>Brian Harman</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Gender</td><td width=251>Male</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Age</td><td width=251>36 years old</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Date of birth</td><td width=251>January 19, 1987</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Birthplace</td><td width=251>Savannah, Georgia</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Height</td><td width=251>5 feet 7 inches</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Weight</td><td width=251>70 kg</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Mother</td><td width=251>Nancy Harman</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Father</td><td width=251>Eric Harman</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Siblings</td><td width=251>Not known</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Spouse</td><td width=251>Kelly Van Slyke</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Children</td><td width=251>Cooper Marie</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Education</td><td width=251>University of Georgia</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Profession</td><td width=251>Golfer</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Religion</td><td width=251>Not known</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Zodiac sign</td><td width=251>Not known</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Nationality</td><td width=251>American</td></tr><tr><td width=250>Net worth</td><td width=251>$9 million</td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_Lesser-Known_Facts_About_B_Harman></span>Some Lesser-Known Facts About B Harman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><li>Brian Harman is married to his wife Kelly Van Slyke and has a child named Cooper Marie.</li><li>Brian currently resides in Sea Island, Georgia, with his family.</li><li>Brian’s first PGA Tour win was the 2014 John Deere Classic.</li><li>Harman played on the winning 2005 and 2009 Walker Cup and 2007 Palmer Cup teams as an amateur.</li><p>FAQs Related to B Harmam</p><p>1.
