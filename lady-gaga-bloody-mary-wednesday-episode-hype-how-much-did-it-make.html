When fans of Wednesday began dancing to <strong><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a></strong>'s 2011 song "Bloody Mary", this was great for the pop singer.

Of course, this is the last thing that she wants to do. She surprises and impresses her classmates by dancing to The Cramps song "Goo Goo Muck." This scene was exciting for a number of reasons.</p><p>It was cool to see such a serious character enjoy herself. And it was great to see this side of Jenna Ortega as well. The actress has become super famous over the past few years thanks to horror movies like Scream (2022), Scream IV, and X. And watching Ortega as Wednesday has been incredible. <a href=#>Jenna Ortega came up with the dance moves</a>, which is awesome. And when watching the scene, it's clear that the actress really gave it her all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lady-gaga-3.jpg><p>The dance scene went viral. While Wednesday became a hit right away, there's no doubt that Wednesday's dance took it to another level. Fans began rewatching Ortega's moves over and over again. And fans began dancing like this beloved character and playing Lady Gaga's 2011 song "Bloody Mary" in the background. Even the singer herself took notice of the many TikTok videos.</p><p>In December 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga danced like Wednesday</a> on TikTok, according to NME.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is "Bad Romance" Lady Gaga's Most Financially Successful Song Or Is It Eclipsed By Her Blockbuster Movie Singles?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>NME.com reported that Madonna even danced like Wednesday Addams, too, and played "Bloody Mary" in the background. The pop stars used to fight a lot. Several publications guessed that with this video, Madonna was suggesting that everything is fine between them now. This was cool to see and proved just how beloved Wednesday has become.</p><p>After the Lady Gaga dance, the Twitter profile for Wednesday Addams tweeted, "I see you doing my dance moves to @LadyGaga’s Bloody Mary.

In an interview with Variety at the 2023 Golden Globe Awards, Ortega talked about the TikTok dance. She sounded amazed by everything that had happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lady-gaga-2.jpg><p>Ortega said, “It’s really strange. You know what’s funny? A long time ago I worked with a hairdresser that worked with Gaga and I just had seen Gaga in concert a few years before. [The hairdresser got] Gaga [to make] me a video saying she heard I was a fan."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ortega continued to Variety, "Gaga made me a sweet video. I doubt she remembers. But to see her to do that now…it’s one of those moments you realize life changes really fast.”</p><p>When asked about the singer playing a role in season 2 of Wednesday, Ortega said, "I'm sure Netflix would love that. I think Mrs. Thornhill and Wednesday had this weird mentor relationship or kind of understood each other in a certain way, so, if Lady Gaga were to be a part, I think it would have to be two monsters that understand each other."</p><h2 id=did-lady-gaga-make-money-from-her-quot-bloody-mary-quot-wednesday-dance>Did Lady Gaga Make Money From Her "Bloody Mary" Wednesday Dance?</h2><p>When a TV show or movie has a great soundtrack, singers or bands often get a boost from the popularity. It looks like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Bloody Mary" became more successful</a> after Lady Gaga shared her TikTok dancing like Wednesday Addams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Billboard, "Bloody Mary" was streamed 1.8 million times. And then, from November 25th to December 2022, sales increased by 1,133%. The song made it into the Billboard Global 200 and sat at Number 54. And while "Bloody Mary" was at Number 168 on the Global Excl. U.S., it moved up to Number 35.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lady-gaga-1.jpg><p>On November 27th, 2022, Chart Data tweeted, "@ladygaga's "Bloody Mary" earns its biggest streaming day of all-time on Spotify, 11 years after release (429K)."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Lady Gaga Revealed The Details Of Justin Timberlake And Andy Samberg's 'Nervous' Pitch For Their SNL Skit</a></span></p><p>According to USA Today, musicians make $0.0033 each time their song is streamed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Spotify works on something called "streamshare." Musicians earn money according to the deal that they have. Spotify gives money to the people who own the music, and those people give money to the band or singer.</p><p>Since Lady Gaga has a $320 million net worth, it seems likely that she is earning a lot of money from her music. This must include streaming. And since she is such a big name, she must have a good deal that allows her to benefit from Spotify streams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lady-gaga.jpg><p>It makes sense that Lady Gaga would want to dance like Wednesday and use her song "Bloody Mary" in the background. Wednesday Addams can't be ignored and "Bloody Mary" is an attention-grabbing song. According to American Songwriter, the singer wrote the song about Mary Magdalene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lady Gaga said, “I believe that Mary Magdalene was both fully divine and fully human. She has to be strong when Jesus fulfills the prophecy to die for everyone’s sins, but she still has the moment of humanity where she’s upset to let him go. She had to be a superstar, but she must have cried too.”</p><p>"Bloody Mary" is on Lady Gaga's second album, "Born This Way," which came out in 2011. It features other infamous songs like "Judas" and the title track. While "Bloody Mary" has gotten attention over the years, casual fans of Lady Gaga might be more familiar with her other hits like "Poker Face," "Just Dance," and "Perfect Illusion." It must have been exciting for Lady Gaga to watch so many of her fans dance to "Bloody Mary" just like Wednesday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijmpypYrSis8BmmaWnn5nGbrnAq7Bmr5WZu6a%2Fw5qwZp2gnsCwsMRmn7KolWK1sMOMpqycoF2ZtqV5yK1kppmbmnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
