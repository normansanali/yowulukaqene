He started his career as an actor on&nbsp;<strong>Saturday Night Live</strong>,&nbsp;and <a href=#>his performance on that show turned him into a huge star</a>. However, most of his wealth comes from the several&nbsp;high-grossing movies he has starred in and his stand-up comedy special deal with Netflix.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything We Know About Eddie Murphy's 10 Kids</a></span></p><p>Some of Eddie Murphy's&nbsp;most successful movies include&nbsp;Beverly Hills Cop, Dr. Dolitte,&nbsp;<i>Mulan,&nbsp;</i>and all four films in the&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;franchise. The&nbsp;Shrek&nbsp;films collectively grossed about $3 billion at the box office, and Murphy took home quite the pay check for his role as Donkey. <a href=#>According to reports, he received a&nbsp;$12 million salary for his work in Shrek Forever After&nbsp;and he took home a significant percentage of the box office revenue</a>&nbsp;as well. In addition, he is reportedly&nbsp;earning approximately&nbsp;$70 million from&nbsp;his new stand-up deal with Netflix.</p><p>Clearly, Eddie Murphy has done very well for himself financially. But is the same true for his family members? Here's what we know about Eddie Murphy's family members' net worths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eddie-murphy-s-family><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eddie Murphy's Family</span></h2><p>Unlike many Hollywood celebrities, Eddie Murphy doesn't have many family members in the public eye. Neither of his parents were entertainers, nor are any of his children. However, his&nbsp;brother Charlie Murphy was an actor and comedian, and his step-brother Vernon Lynch has worked as a television producer. Eddie Murphy has also dated and had children with several famous women, including models, singers, and television presenters.</p><h2 id=charlie-murphy-2-5-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Charlie Murphy ($2.5 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eddie Murphy's most famous blood relative was his brother Charlie Murphy, who was a successful actor and stand-up comedian in his own right. He was a writer and performer on&nbsp;Chappelle's Show&nbsp;and also played a main role on the TV series&nbsp;Black Jesus.&nbsp;Sadly, he passed away in 2017 at just 57 years of age.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Charlie Murphy had a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;$2.5 million when he died</a>.</p><h2 id=vernon-lynch-unknown><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Vernon Lynch (Unknown)</span></h2><p>Vernon Lynch is Eddie Murphy's step-brother from his mother's second marriage. Lynch co-wrote the 1995 film&nbsp;Vampire in Brooklyn&nbsp;alongside Murphy, and he also worked as a music consultant on one of Murphy's most recent films,&nbsp;Coming 2 America.&nbsp;In addition, Vernon Lynch served as an executive producer on&nbsp;Hollywood Exes,&nbsp;a reality show which starred Eddie Murphy's ex-wife Nicole. Unfortunately, Vernon Lynch's net worth is not listed on Celebrity Net Worth, so it's unclear how much money he has today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Eddie Murphy Almost Made A 'Coming To America' TV Show</a></span></p><h2 id=mel-b-6-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mel B ($6 Million)</span></h2><p>Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B, is a member of the popular 1990s girl group The Spice Girls. <a href=#>She dated Eddie Murphy for a few months in 2006</a>, and although the two never married, <a href=#>Murphy allegedly had plans to propose</a>. Melanie Brown&nbsp;is included on this list because she and Eddie Murphy have a daughter together, <a href=#>a 14-year-old girl named Angel</a>. While Angel is still just a child and there is no reason to&nbsp;speculate about her net worth, we can report that her mother has <a href=#>an estimated $6 million fortune according to Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-mitchell-murphy-10-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Nicole Mitchell Murphy ($10 Million)</span></h2><p>While Eddie Murphy has been in several high-profile relationships, and while he has ten children with four different women, he has only been married once in his life. From&nbsp;1993-2006, he was married to Nicole Mitchell Murphy, with whom he has five children. While Nicole is perhaps best known for her marriage to Murphy, she was a successful model for several years and she also starred in 3 seasons of the reality TV program&nbsp;Hollywood Exes.&nbsp;<a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth, she is worth $10 million today</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Much Eddie Murphy Pays In Child Support</a></span></p><h2 id=tracey-edmonds-60-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Tracey Edmonds&nbsp;($60 Million)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Briefly after his relationship with Mel B, Eddie&nbsp;Murphy had&nbsp;a romance with Tracey Edmonds. Edmonds is n Emmy Award-winning TV presenter, known for her work hosting&nbsp;Extra. She is also&nbsp;a film and TV producer, having produced films such as&nbsp;<i>Soul Food&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;Good Luck Chuck.&nbsp;From 1992 until 2005, she was married to the Grammy-winning singer and songwriter Babyface.&nbsp;Edmonds and Murphy&nbsp;appeared to have a wedding ceremony in January 2008, <a href=#>but they broke up shortly afterwards</a>. The couple later clarified that <a href=#>their wedding&nbsp;was just "symbolic" in nature and that they did&nbsp;not have a "legal ceremony."</a></p><h2 id=paige-butcher-unknown><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Paige Butcher (Unknown)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Paige Butcher is currently in a relationship with Eddie Murphy, and the two have been dating since at least 2012.

However, no matter what her true net worth is, it's safe to assume that Butcher is financially stable due to&nbsp;her relationship with Eddie Murphy.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Why Eddie Murphy Quit Acting For Six Years</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIyaqZ5llZmxqrGMpqyrqJiuwG6ywKagpbFdorKursSrqmavn6fBqXnIp2RraGJmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
