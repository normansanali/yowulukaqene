Back then, if a wrestler had an injury, they would normally do all that they could to hide it and simply try to work through it. That's not as easy to do today. WWE's Superstars undergo extensive tests and while that is ultimately a good thing, it has led to some sad moments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Take Paige, for instance. If the Brit was wrestling during the 1990s, the neck issues that have forced her to retire so young might not have been picked up. She might have even chosen to continue wrestling. We now know that a decision like that could be a fatal one. It's heartbreaking that we will likely never see Paige wrestle again, but it's better than seeing her hurt herself further between the ropes.</p><p style=text-align:center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>MATT HARDY THINKS SETH ROLLINS SHOULD BE THE FACE OF WWE</a></strong></p><p>Another Superstar who was seemingly given similar news to Paige was <a href=#>Matt Hardy</a>. The veteran insinuated in 2018 that an issue with his back had forced him to retire earlier than he may have liked. However, whether he is done for good or not has been up in the air. This past weekend, the man himself confirmed that he has not retired, and is physically ready to return to the ring.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"No, I am not retired & not going to be retiring anytime soon," Hardy wrote on Twitter. The Woken One also gave the impression that WWE has cleared him to return to action, stating that he has "physically been greenlit." What's even more promising about this news is that Hardy revealed he is in the best shape he has been in for years and is the lightest he has been for 20 years.</p><p><strong>The news about Hardy's back was a bitter pill to swallow. Invested wrestling fans had been waiting to see Hardy's Woken persona in WWE for a long time, and there feels like there is still so much more to see. Now it seems as if we will get that. Hopefully, when Hardy does return to TV, he will bring Bray Wyatt with him. We haven't seen Wyatt since Hardy left, and there is no word on anything being up with the former WWE Champion in terms of injuries.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p style=text-align:center><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>SASHA BANKS THINKS WWE HAS "WAY TOO MANY PPVS"</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e8yaq61lmJa%2FpcWMp6atZaKawaq%2BxJ1ksK%2BVYr%2BmwNSrpWg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
