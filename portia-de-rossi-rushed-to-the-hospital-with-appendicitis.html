It was appendicitis and she had surgery,” the insider reveals. “Portia is&nbsp;now resting at home and Ellen is taking care of her. It was a scare at first, but all good now.”</p><p>The talk show host, 63, and the Arrested Development alum, 48, <a href=#>married in August 2008</a>. Though they met in 2000, their relationship didn’t turn romantic until four years before they wed.</p><p>“I ran into Ellen at a photo shoot about a year ago and she took my breath away. That had never happened to me in my life, where I saw somebody and [experienced] all of those things you hear about in songs and read about in poetry,” de Rossi told The Advocate in August 2005. “My knees were weak. It was amazing.

And for that, I am sorry. Anyone who knows me knows it’s the opposite of what I believe and what I hoped for our show.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The couple have had their share of health scares recently. In December 2020, <a href=#>DeGeneres tested positive for COVID-19.</a></p><p>“Hi Everyone, I want to let you all know that I have tested positive for COVID-19,” she tweeted at the time. “Fortunately, I am feeling fine right now.”</p><p>Though it is unclear whether de Rossi was infected, the talk show host assured fans she was following proper guidelines, saying, “Anyone who has been in close contact with me has been notified.” She returned to her show in January after recovering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapp6KptqJ5w55kq6ejqLZuvtSsn56cXam8bsDHnmShp6OltrWty2auoqyYYq6xvMSnm6Kbmam2tHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
