Although the innocent taxi driver in The Long Shadow was not named, in real life, the false suspect was<strong>&nbsp;Terry Hawkshaw</strong>. He was portrayed in the drama series by Irish actor Ian Lloyd Anderson.</p><p id=e7Q43JkW4-V data-wc=38>According to the Scottish Daily Mail, Terry was made a prime suspect after his car was noticed by police at red light district areas and because he matched the description police were given by one of the victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0efaec8163c0-the-long-shadow-terry.png><p id=egtEXnBWS2s data-wc=38><strong>In 1977, Terry was arrested and held for hours for questioning and was placed under 24 hour surveillance</strong> despite being innocent.

Sutcliffe was finally caught after being pulled over by an officer in Sheffield on January 2, 1981. Over the following day, Sutcliffe described his attacks and even claimed to have heard voices telling him to commit the crimes. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1f3881511163-long-shadow-cast-itv.jpg><p id=ett6XwfRj9J data-wc=45>He eventually pleaded not guilty to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. After a two-week trial at London's Old Bailey, Sutcliffe was found guilty of murder on all 13 counts and attempting to murder seven other women.</p><p id=exBnjmY0eig data-wc=21>He was sentenced to twenty concurrent sentences of life imprisonment.
