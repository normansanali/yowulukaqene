You never really know what other people are gonna pull. I wanted to feel safe. In the long run that didn’t really end up working out, Juliette, 22, explained on Us Weekly’s “Watch With Us” podcast in February. “We’ve been on and off for a long time. We went back and forth a lot. I broke up with him in October for about a month; it was a toxic relationship. We tried again until about a month ago. After that, I was like, ‘We just have to rip the Band-aid off.’”</p><p>While the Florida State University graduate moved on with Bachelorette alum <strong><a href=#>Robby Hayes</a></strong>, she alleged that Alex <a href=#>cheated on Alyssa with her in recent months.</a></p><p>“Weird how he cheated on her with me several months ago but ok,” Juliette commented on The Morning Toast’s <a href=#>Instagram</a> post about the announcement on Sunday evening. (Us has reached out to Alex for a comment regarding the allegations.)</p><p>As for her relationship with Robby, fans will see their romance play out on season 3 of Siesta Key. The pair, who first connected at Stagecoach in April, <a href=#>called it quits after several months of dating.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think there’s a lot of highs and then the low. I feel like it just kind of fizzled,” Robby told Us earlier this month.</p><p>“I mean honestly we were in our own bubble and we went back to Siesta Key and things just got real again and reality set in,” Juliette added. “And we’re on a TV show that has a lot of stress. So you know, things happen. But you’ll see it’s good.”</p><p>Scroll through for five things we know about Alyssa:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrq3F0qyYZquRobKzus5mbGasmJ67qL%2BMraZmo56kxG6twaisrWWRobK5ecqopKmnpJ2ypL7ArGSpqpWcu6K602aen2ejnbK0ecWrpqZllqG8s7XDmmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
