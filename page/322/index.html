Answer
In this respect, what is the location of the fuel pressure regulator on the Silverado?
The fuel pressure regulator is located on the top driver’s side section of the engine, immediately below the plastic intake manifold shroud. It is not visible from the front of the vehicle (See Resources for example).
In a similar vein, where exactly is the fuel pressure sensor? This sensor is often situated in the centre of the fuel rail and is connected to the engine control unit (ECU), which serves as the vehicle’s primary computer and controls the engine. <a href=../../where-is-the-fuel-pressure-regulator-located-on-2005-silverado-html.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../who-are-the-family-members-of-bob-barker.html>Who Are The Family Members Of Bob Barker?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
