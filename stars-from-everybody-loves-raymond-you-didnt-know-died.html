Looking back on how he got involved with the show, <a href=#>Boyle recalled</a> a hectic audition process involving a changed location, trouble with parking, and missing identification for his family who accompanied him to the audition; when he finally walked in the room, he remembered being "grouchy." "I barked at him..." Boyle said of Phil Rosenthal, "and I got the job, because I was in character."</p><p dir=ltr>While filming the show, Boyle survived a heart attack on set. He told the <a href=#>Archive of American Television</a>, "[I] had this cough and cold sweat and everything, and I joked that I probably would have a heart attack. And then the Assistant Director came over, and says, 'I think you're having a heart attack.'" He was back to work within two weeks. â€‹</p><p dir=ltr>Boyle, otherwise best known as the tap-dancing monster in "Young Frankenstein,"&nbsp;<a href=#>passed away in 2006</a>&nbsp;having had both heart disease and multiple myeloma. He had lived an exciting life, including having been a monastery student and having John Lennon as the best man at his wedding.&nbsp;After he died, Brad Garrett, who played his son Robert, told <a href=#>CBS News</a>, "I've lost an amazing friend and colleague. Being able to share nine years with Peter on 'Raymond' and witness his talent and humanity was an honor." Doris Roberts, who played Frank's nosy wife Marie, mourned, "It's like losing a spouse."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb29lZoVxe9KtmKurXZu%2FsLmMnq2eqqmXvKXFjKWmr52jYr%2BixcyopZ1lqaTCbrDInaWtZZujvLh5w6KcnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
