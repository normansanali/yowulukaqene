She wrote on her MySpace page in a blog posted earlier today: “I have been told by 2 back surgeons that I should never set foot in a wrestling ring again if I want to be moving around in a few years on my own. Pretty depressing if you ask me.” She also added, “My health is doing ok as far as back problems. I must say there are days that I wake up and ask myself why the heck I put my body through what I did the last few years but it’s all worth it. I can never trade all of the awesome experiences that I have had in the WWE and of course all of the great life long friends that I have made along the way.” Torrie also talks about WrestleMania weekend, heading over to Japan to do promotional work for WWE, staying home after being on the road practically every week for the past seven years, and more.</p><p>A newspaper writer out of Mexico, Arturo Rivera, publicly complained in a column last week that WWE didn’t announce that Rey Mysterio was hurt and would miss the Raw brand’s upcoming tour of Mexico until after tickets were put on sale on the heavily advertised first day.</p><p>Two weeks worth of SmackDown & ECW shows will be taped over the course of a weekend in early June. They’ll be holding a rare Saturday night taping on June 7 at the Save Mart Center in Fresno, California. The next night, they’ll be taping in San Jose at the H.P. Pavilion. They’re taping the shows on a weekend because the crew is going on another tour of Australia and New Zealand later in the week.</p><p>Melina’s latest blog on WWE.com gives props to Mae Young after her recent induction into the WWE Hall of Fame. “Her passion, love, determination and dedication drives me and inspires me. Thank you for everything you have given, Mae,” Melina wrote.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfo9wbGpvXam8s77InmSwoZyovK9506ijnWWemsOmvoytpmaqlanCs7qMprCsrJWntrB5zairnqtdmrC4v8M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
