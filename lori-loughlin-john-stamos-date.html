Loughlin and Stamos played love interests, Rebecca Donaldson and Jesse Katsopolis, on ABC’s Full House from seven seasons from 1988 to 1995.</p><p>They also starred together in the series’ Netflix reboot, Fuller House, from Seasons 1 to 4. But what if we told you that, while Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse were forming a connection on-screen, Loughlin and Samos wree also doing the same off screen?</p><p>In his new book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">If You Would Have Told Me</a>, Stamos claimed that he and Loughlin were on the “precipice of turning romantic” before he made the decision to just stay friends, describing their bond as “sort of true friendship that’s supposed to be the foundation of a great, lasting relationship.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Stamos went on to marry model Rebecca Romijn</a>, whom he met at a party after the 1994 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which he attended with Loughlin as friends. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">InStyle</a> in October 2023, Stamos recalled having to decide to pursue a relationship with Loughlin or Romijn. “In my mind it was like … the two Sandys in Grease!” he said.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/If-You-Would-Have-Told-Me-John-Stamos.jpg alt='"If You Would Have Told Me" by John Stamos' width=1024 height=1556 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=wp-caption-text>Courtesy of Henry Holt & Co.</p><p>As fans know, Stamos chose Romijn and the couple started dating two months later. They married in 1998 and divorced in 2004 after six years of marriage. “My <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">first marriage was shattering to me</a>. I was shattered for way too long, too,” Stamos told People in October 2023. “I mean, a year, OK, good. But it went on [for] years and years.”</p><p>Stamos went on to tell the magazine that it was “really difficult” to write his book’s chapters about his marriage to Romijn because it took him back to the emotions he was feeling at the time. “In my mind back then, she was the Devil, and I just hated her,” he said. “I couldn’t believe how much I hated her, and it ruined my life.”</p><p>He continued, “One of the steps in AA, the fourth step, is you lay out all your grievances, everything that people did to you. And then I said, ‘Oh, she did this, she did that, blah, blah, she did blah, blah.’ And then my sponsor goes, ‘Now what part did you play in that?’ And I go, like, ‘None.'”</p><p>Through Alcoholic’s Anonymous, Stamos realized he also played “some part” in his failed marriage with Romijn. “You start thinking, it’s like, ‘Oh, she wasn’t the Devil. Maybe I was as much to blame as her,'” he said.</p><p>Though Stamos and Loughlin never officially dated, they’ve remained friends for more than three decades. <a href=# rel=noopener>Louglin, for her part</a>, was married to her first husband, Michael Burns, from 1989 to 1996.She married her second husband, Mossimo Giannulli, in 1997. They share two children: daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose.</p><p><strong>For more on Lori Loughlin’s relationships, check out our gallery below on <a href=# rel=noopener>who the When Calls the Heart cast is dating and married to in real life</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhuaWt%2BdoCOpaaroV2hvLazx6Wgp2WapLWvedKtmKano2KxosDEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
