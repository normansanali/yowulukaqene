Marie Osmond was also worried about her son after he told her his depression had returned, and she'd planned to meet him the following week. "I'm not a depressed person, but I understand that place, that darkness. I told him, I said, 'Mike, I'm gonna be there Monday, and it's gonna be okay.' But depression doesn't wait 'til Monday," Osmond told Oprah Winfrey in <a href=#>a heartbreaking sit-down</a>.</p><p>Not surprisingly, when she learned that Michael had died, Osmond was utterly devastated. "I thought someone had run a knife into my heart," she admitted in her 2013 memoir, "The Key Is Love" (via <a href=#>People</a>). "Not a day goes by that Michael isn't my first thought in the morning and my last before I fall asleep." Although Osmond missed the chance to say one final goodbye to Michael, she took comfort in the fact that he knew how much he was loved. "My one consolation is that I never end a conversation with my children without saying 'I love you,'" Osmond shared. "It was the last thing I said to my son."</p><p>Meanwhile, the pain never disappears, but you learn to live with it over time. "You cry until then you can't cry, and then you cry some more," Osmond wrote in her memoir. "Some people don't talk about these things, but we do. I think it's important. I'm healing every day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoaoByhY6wn5qsXaKus7XEZqaspZ%2BjsW6%2FwKKbZpmSpMK1ecOemK2gXai8r3nMopqhmZWhfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
