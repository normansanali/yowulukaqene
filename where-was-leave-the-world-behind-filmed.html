What starts as a leisurely holiday turns into a blackout as the family realizes the world around them seems to be crumbling. With no technology left, the family must partner with the home’s true owner, G. H. Scott (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mahershala Ali</a>), and his daughter Ruth (Myha’la Herrold) to survive.</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Most of the film is shot exactly where it is set. All filming took place in New York State, specifically around Westchester County in May 2022. Supporting scenes were captured around the area, from Pleasantville, Lewisboro, and a nearby hamlet called Katonah, nestled in the town of Bedford, New York. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Riverhead Local newspaper</a> claims that the Riverhead Township served as the primary location for the film’s remote exterior shots.</p><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>The house itself, a 5,000-square-foot modern farmhouse, can be found in Old Westbury. The recently renovated home was designed by John Winberry, a partner at the 12-person-strong Long Island City architecture firm. The house, affectionately called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Open Corner</a>, is designed to capture sunlight every hour of the day, leading to some spectacular open-concept looks that are perfect for the end of the world.
