Some people who came to hear the decision were turned away. At the door, guards were stationed.</span></p><span data-mce-type=bookmark class=mce_SELRES_start></span><p><span>On all 12 counts, the judge, Nancy Margaret Russo, pronounced guilty verdicts.</span></p><p><span>She cited CCTV evidence showing Shirilla’s car speeding down the street at up to 100 mph right before the collision.</span></p><p><span>“This is the kind of proof you can never take away from you. The aural and visual components of this display are indelible. It is horrific and awful,” remarked Judge Russo.</span></p><p><strong><span>SEE ALSO: <span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Guy With Axe And A Baby Open Door Video</a></span></span></strong></p><p><span>“The defendant’s intention and motive are made very obvious in the video. The decision she made that day was one of death and ruin. She changed from being a careful driver to becoming genuine hell on wheels.</span></p><p><span>The then-17-year-old allegedly pushed on the throttle, accelerated along a dead-end roadway in a Strongsville business park, and purposefully smashed into a brick wall, killing her boyfriend and another young man, according to Cuyahoga County prosecutors.</span></p><p><span>Tim Troup, an assistant Cuyahoga County prosecutor, demonstrated security footage from the incident site and data collected from Shirilla’s car, arguing that “It shows strikingly 100% acceleration through the entire final five seconds.”</span></p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-51795 decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thetalkstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Full-8-Minutes-Video-Mackenzie-Shirilla-Car-Video.png alt="Mackenzie Shirilla Car Accident Video" width=702 height=481 data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-51795 class=wp-caption-text>Mackenzie Shirilla Car Accident Video</p><p><span>Davion Flanagan, 19, a recent graduate of Strongsville High School, and Dominic Russo, Shirilla’s boyfriend, both perished in the collision.</span></p><p><span>“The evidence as a whole clearly shows that Mackenzie Shirilla behaved on purpose. This was murder, not careless driving, according to Judge Russo.</span></p><p><span>As Shrilla was being led away by sheriff’s deputies, her family members could be heard telling her they loved her.</span></p><p><span>On Monday, August 21, at 1 p.m., she will be sentenced. Shirilla’s defense lawyer is attempting to prevent her from receiving a life sentence for the alleged double murder by claiming that no one knows what took on inside that automobile.</span></p><p><span>Judge Russo was informed by James McDonnell that “it’s not clear, it’s not explicit to draw the inference that she acted purposely.”</span></p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrBorjKrKuonJGue6S7zGidrqScYoVuucinrK2do2LDqrDEqGSmmZOgsq%2FGyJ5krKCZp7atuMBmmpqqXau2pbHOaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
