Its heartwood has a medium brown color, while the sapwood is cream or beige.</p><p dir=ltr>Due to the <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/top-fast-growing-trees/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">fast growth of the white ash tree</a>, the sapwood can be substantial, which actually isn’t a bad thing. <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/3-ways-for-woodworkers-to-save-money/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">Woodworkers</a> often seek out the pale, creamy color of ash sapwood as an alternative to the brown color of white oak. In general, ash’s workability is similar to white oak.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=types-of-ash-wood></span>Types of Ash Wood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p dir=ltr>Here are three main types of ash trees, plus two other terms to know:</p><ul><li><strong>White ash:</strong> White ash grows in the Eastern U.S. and is noted for its lighter brown heartwood color compared to its cousin, the black ash. It has good dimensional stability and a Janka hardness rating of 1,320 pound-force (lbf). The Janka rating comes from a test that measures the density of <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/common-woodworking-materials/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">wood species</a>. For context, cherry has a Janka rating of 950 lbf and white oak comes in at 1,360 lbf.</li><li><strong>Black ash:</strong> Growing in the Northeastern U.S. and Canada, the black ash is slightly darker in color and less dense than white ash, with a Janka rating of 850 lbf. Black ash, however, is notable as the preferred species of the destructive <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/tree-paint-meaning/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">emerald ash borer</a>.</li><li><strong>European ash:</strong> Largely indistinguishable from white ash, European ash grows in Europe and southwestern Asia. The only practical way to know if you are purchasing European ash is to ask where the lumber was sourced.</li><li><strong>Swamp ash:</strong> Not a distinct species of ash, but a term often used by luthiers (someone who makes stringed instruments) to describe the lightweight lumber of an ash tree that grew in a wet or swampy area.</li><li><strong>Olive ash:</strong> Again, not a distinct species of ash, but a term used to describe the dark, streaky heartwood found in some ash trees that resembles the wood of olive trees. Most commercially available olive ash occurs as imported European ash.</li></ul><p dir=ltr>The emerald ash borer beetle is believed to have been inadvertently introduced to North America from Asia in the 1990s. Lacking any natural predators, it spread across the continent in the last few decades. It has already ruined hundreds of millions of ash trees. It is believed that ash populations will continue to decline as much as 80 percent over the next 75 years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-pros-and-cons-of-ash-wood></span>The Pros and Cons of Ash Wood<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=pros></span>Pros<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ash can be found at nearly all hardwood lumber retailers.</li><li><strong>Price:</strong> Ash is among the <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/article/how-to-find-affordable-lumber/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">least expensive domestic hardwoods</a> to purchase commercially.</li><li><strong>Durability:</strong> Ash is a dense, tough wood that can take a beating and maintain its beauty.</li></ul><h3 dir=ltr><span class=ez-toc-section id=cons></span>Cons<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li dir=ltr><strong>Color:</strong> Many ash boards will have some mix of heartwood and sapwood, making color matching more difficult.</li><li dir=ltr><strong>Rot resistance:</strong> Ash is rated poorly for rot resistance and insect resistance, making it a less than ideal choice for <a href=# data-name=www.familyhandyman.com/list/39-outdoor-woodworking-projects-for-beginners/ data-module="content engagement" data-position="embedded links">outdoor woodworking projects</a>.</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-ash-wood-used-for></span>What Is Ash Wood Used For?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p dir=ltr>Ash is used in lots of applications, including:</p><ul readability=1><li readability=0><p dir=ltr><strong>Furniture:</strong> Tables, chairs and anything that requires durability.</p></li><li readability=0><p dir=ltr><strong>Utility woodwork:</strong> From flooring to crates to interior millwork, ash is chosen for its toughness.</p></li><li readability=-1><p dir=ltr><strong>Baseball bats:</strong> That’s right!

Expect to pay from $5 to $10 per board foot, depending on width and grade. For comparison, most other furniture-grade domestic hardwoods cost from $5 to $15 per board foot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p63MoqOyoJGjsbq5wKdlnKedZK6zwMico55np6S8pcPOq6KippdixKmt02arqGWbo7y4ecCbpq6sXZbAqXnWqKadZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
