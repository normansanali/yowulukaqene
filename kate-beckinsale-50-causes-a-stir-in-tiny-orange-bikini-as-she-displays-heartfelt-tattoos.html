Following her appearance at the Kings Trust Gala in New York City, she felt compelled to revisit the topic. In a candid Instagram post, she shared clips that she estimated to be nearly 20 years apart to illustrate her point.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4daf8453b6c-snapinstaapp4502355578262100927706066787930144624734899n1080.jpg><p id=eZzMd8nXPud data-wc=29>"I hate talking about this because I hate adding to this conversation, but I'm doing it because insidious bullying of any kind over time takes a toll," she began.&nbsp;</p><p id=e0BCWriRgM4 data-wc=60>"These videos might be 20 years apart – maybe more. Every time I post anything – and by the way, this has been the case since I was about 30 – I am accused of having had [unrecognizable] surgery/using Botox using fillers/being obsessed with looking younger, and it's really such a tiresome and subtly vicious way to bully a person."</p><p id=evwEhfqo5G2 data-wc=22>To further silence the skeptics, Kate categorically denied having undergone plastic surgery, even involving a professional plastic surgeon to verify her claims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e698a06f0817-snapinstaapp45038276518392681066007905798255817854706779n1080-1.jpg><p id=eCy2sefIKgQ data-wc=87>She expressed frustration that many of the negative comments seemed to come from other women, adding, "I'm not too concerned about aging – because I found my father dead at the age of 5, I spent most of my teenage years and a good deal of my 20s absolutely crippled with severe anxiety and panic attacks that I was going to die of a heart attack too, and went to emergency rooms often, and was almost, at that time of my life, completely [immobilized] by that anxiety."</p><p id=eeVUOe1l1xo data-wc=90>In her detailed post, Kate also explained the changes in her appearance over the years. "As you can see from these two videos, what is different is that I lived in the UK and was paler. I used to pluck the [expletive] out of my eyebrows, and I loved that brown lipstick that everybody wore. I had a fuller face, as most of us do in our late teens and 20s. Makeup techniques were matte, not nearly so glossy. I thought contours were something I found difficult in geography lessons."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
