Blanket, 22, and Katherine initially teamed up against the executors of Michael’s estate after they planned to use his money for an undisclosed business deal.</p><p>The court ruled in the executors’ favor earlier this month, but Katherine is now appealing the decision. Blanket, however, is on the opposing side.</p><p>Blanket does not want his late father’s estate to pay for his grandmother’s legal bills amid the appeal. Court docs reveal that Blanket does not believe Katherine will win the case and has asked the court to grant her “reasonable attorney’s fees incurred from the pre-appeal battle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blanket-Jackson-Takes-Grandmother-to-Court-Over-Money-From-Michael-Estate-2.jpg><p>Michael welcomed Blanket via surrogate in February 2002. Months after his son’s birth, Michael infamously held Blanket over the railing of a Berlin hotel balcony in November 2002, showing off the then-9-month-old to a crowd of adoring fans. (A towel was placed over Blanket’s head at the time.)</p><p>“I offer no excuses for what happened,” Michael said in a statement following the incident. “I got caught up in the excitement of the moment. I would never intentionally endanger the lives of my children.”</p><p>The late singer <a href=#>was also the father</a> of <strong>Prince</strong>, 27, and <strong>Paris Jackso</strong>n, 25.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Michael died at age 50 in June 2009 after suffering a cardiac arrest in his Los Angeles home. Two years after his sudden death, it was determined that Michael died from a propofol overdose, which was administered by his doctor, <strong>Conrad Murray</strong>, who has since been convicted of involuntary manslaughter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blanket-Jackson-Takes-Grandmother-to-Court-Over-Money-From-Michael-Estate-3.jpg><p>More than a decade after Michael’s death, <a href=#>a new biopic</a> titled Michael was announced in January 2023, with his nephew <strong>Jaafar Jackson</strong> set to take on the title role. (<strong>Miles Teller</strong>, <strong>Colman Domingo</strong> and <strong>Nia Long</strong> have also been cast.)</p><p>“Proud to announce Jaafar Jackson as Michael — the motion picture event that explores the journey of the man who became the King of Pop.
