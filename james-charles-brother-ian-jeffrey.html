If that's the case, here's a super quick summary: <a href=#>James Charles</a>, a beauty YouTuberand the first male face of CoverGirl, betrayed Tati Westbrook, another major beauty YouTuber. In a 43-minute video, Tati, who was James' mentor and close friend, describes why she no longer can support James.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Since the video was uploaded six days ago, millions have unsubscribed from his YouTube channel and unfollowed his Instagram account, including celebs like Miley Cyrus and Kylie Jenner. Many have even <a href=#>accused the beauty influencer of being a predator</a>. But at least one person was thought to be defending him: James Charles' brother, Ian Jeffrey. &nbsp;Here's what we found.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ian Jeffrey posted a vague tweet that is now deleted</h2><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Seventeen</a>, on May 12 Ian tweeted "Why does everyone act so tough on the internet?" right after Westbrook uploaded her video to YouTube and the internet turned on James. In a tweet that's now deleted, <a href=#>Jeffree Star</a> responded, "Why is your brother a predator? Why'd you really move back to NYC? Exactly. Shut the f**k up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">But now we know that Ian Jeffrey wasn't tweeting about his brother, according to James Charles' new explainer video, "No More Lies."</h2><p>In a 41-minute YouTube video, James Charles basically annotates Tati's video, giving an explanation for everything she's accused him of. It's intense, but if you've been following the drama, it's worth the watch. In it, he explains that Ian Jeffrey actually wasn't tweeting about James. He was tweeting about a hometown bully, and Jeffree Star just assumed Ian was defending James.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>James' brother apparently deleted his tweet sometime after Star attacked him, because no trace of this conversation can be found on Twitter. Yikes. The last tweet from Ian Jeffrey is one from May 10 that simply says "Shine bright in a world so dark."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Shine so bright in world so dark</p>— Ian Jeffrey (@ianjd12) <a href=#>May 10, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Ian Jeffrey exactly?</h2><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>We know that Ian is 17 years old, and has his own YouTube channel with over 870,000 subscribers. He only has 10 videos though, and only a couple videos made it past two million views (not too shabby, but certainly not as viral as his big bro). In his most recent video (posted two months ago), Ian talks about the future of fashion for about 18 minutes.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ian's more successful videos include one where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he describes his morning routine in detail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a baking video with James</a>, and his first video which is called "STEALING JAMES CHARLES CAREER," in which he describes why he is now making YouTube videos. Before creating his own YouTube channel, Ian appeared in some of James' beauty tutorials, like the one below from 2017:</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While we don't know a lot about Ian Jeffrey, we do know that both brothers were raised in New York and went to Bethlehem Central High School (Ian graduates soon). According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian's Twitter</a>, he lives in Los Angeles (but if we're to believe Jeffree Star, Ian allegedly moved back to NYC—maybe to finish high school?). Along with having Twitter and YouTube accounts, Ian has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram with 2.2 million followers</a>. The feed is pretty much just selfies and photo shoots that show Ian is really into fashion, likes pizza and bubble gum soda, and probably makes a living by posting sponsored content (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like this ad for Goat shoes</a>). While James was famous for his makeup skills in high school, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ian was on the school's football team</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">However, Ian recently posted to Twitter that he's still figuring things out.</h2><p>Which is totally normal for someone who is about to graduate high school.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Does anyone still like me lol.

Apparently Ian Jeffrey and Loren Gray dated in late 2018, and made their relationship Insta official in December.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>However, Loren took to Twitter in March of this year to share that she and Ian are no longer dating.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ian and i are no longer together. i’m still always here for him as a friend and we are better that way. thank u&lt;3</p>— loren gray (@iamlorengray) <a href=#>March 17, 2019</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Since Ian's personal brand revolves around fashion, it makes sense that he helped James out his brand, Sisters Apparel.</h2><p>Ian's contributions include hoodies that say "Brothers" on them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>It's unclear why Ian Jeffrey deleted his initial tweet in support of his brother, but we suspect he probably just wants to steer clear of the drama. For someone who is about to graduate high school, that feels totally understandable.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66usdJmmqGZoqGytHnBq6atoJWneqqtzWahnp6Wp7K6</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
