The pal who posted it claims that the money will be used to find “a good attorney” to secure Smith’s release.</p><p>The Jamaica native, 21, had previously launched a GoFundMe campaign in January, asking for the same amount of money to “get a place to stay” after wife <strong>Ashley Martson</strong> filed for divorce. She later withdrew the petition and the fundraiser was pulled down. But Martson, 33, filed for divorce again in April.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Ashley-and-Jay.jpg><p>Earlier this week, Smith, whose real name is Conroy St. Christopher Smith, turned himself in to authorities after learning there was a warrant out for his arrest.</p><p>He was wanted for allegedly violating a probation from abuse order that his estranged wife — who appeared with him on season 6 of 90 Day Fiancé — placed against him on Monday, July 1.</p><p>The pair, who met when Martson was on vacation in the Caribbean and wed in May 2018, had a turbulent relationship, with the new bride <a href=#>catching her husband on the dating app Tinder</a> the day after their wedding.</p><p>As fans of the show know, she found out on the June 23 episode that he had <a href=#>cheated on her a second time</a>, hooking up with a woman in a barbershop bathroom. She subsequently kicked him out of her Pennsylvania home and <a href=#>called the police to try and deport him</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Martson’s rep told Us Weekly that the reality TV star<a href=#> “feels as though Jay made his own bed,”</a> amid his incarceration.</p><p>“Ashley has been suffering for a long time — it’s payback,” her rep told Us. “Jay thought she was joking, but no. “He made his bed, and now he has to lie in it.”</p><p>The warring couple are due back in court on Tuesday, July 11.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGZyaF2Zrrp5xaKYp5uVqHqrrdhmqqahpJ16qa3SZp6oZZaqu6V5zJ5kraddm7%2BmsYyhoKZllqe8rnnDnquepqSevK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
