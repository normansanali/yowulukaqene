I’m like, ‘Hello, <a href=#><strong>Andy [Cohen]</strong></a>, you’re not calling me!’”</p><p>The California resident, <a href=#>who was an original cast member when the Bravo series debuted in 2006</a>, noted that she has since changed her tune.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Vicki-Gunvalson-I-Was-Jealous-Mad-Over-Tamra-Judges-RHOC-Return-00001.jpg><p>“I’m so happy for her,” Vicki explained, noting, “<a href=#>She really wanted it more than me</a>. She’s good TV.”</p><p>The Coto Insurance founder appeared on RHOC from season 1 to season 14. Tamra, for her part, joined the series during season 3 in 2007 and <a href=#>exited one day after Vicki</a> announced her <a href=#>departure in January 2020</a>.</p><p>While the twosome have remained close off screen — and reunited on camera for season 2 of <a href=#>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip</a> earlier this year — it was Tamra, 55, who <a href=#>signed on in July for a full-time role</a> on the original Housewives franchise.</p><p>Vicki told Us on Tuesday that fans <a href=#>will see her on an episode or two of the Orange County-based show</a> now that the Vena CBD founder is back.</p><p>“It was great. Loved it. Loved my girls,” she teased of her “Tres Amigas time” with Tamra and fellow RHOC star <a href=#><strong>Shannon Beador</strong></a>. “I love my Tamra [and] Shannon and we’re good together.”</p><p>Vicki also hinted that <a href=#>becoming a full-time cast member</a> in the future isn’t off the table. “That’s Bravo’s decision, right. And then, at that time, I address it,” she explained. “My filming days hopefully aren’t over.”</p><p>While the former Housewife would happily star alongside Tamra and Shannon, 58, again, she isn’t sure that former costar <a href=#><strong>Heather Dubrow</strong></a> should <a href=#>return to RHOC next season</a>. (Heather, 53, made her Bravo comeback in 2021 on season 16 after previously exiting the show in 2016.)</p><p>“I don’t think Heather really fits in to Orange County anymore. I think she’s more — you know, she’s an actress and she does that,” Vicki told Us. “I just don’t know why she would wanna do that [show again].”</p><p>The <a href=#>TV personality</a> continued: “One of my managers told me years ago, ‘You either want fame or money, and fame is a drug it’s bad for you. But the people that want fame pay a price for it.’ So I just don’t know why she would want that chaos in her life.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Vicki pointed out that <a href=#>Heather has four kids</a> and is a “good” actress, so she doesn’t see why she needs to be part of RHOC. “I wouldn’t [do it] if I had that much money, there’s no way I’m doing a reality show,” she revealed.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2im5ueeqjBza%2BYpaufo3q4rdJmoZ6ZnKTCtHnOr5yrZaSWurOtjKOsnZ%2BVqHqztM6cZKudpKq%2Fr3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
