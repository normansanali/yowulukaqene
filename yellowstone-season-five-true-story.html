He, along with his family, must protect the land, which is in constant conflict with those it borders - an expanding town, an Indian reservation, and America's first national park.</p><p id=eEt6_AVbkGs data-wc=6><strong>WATCH: Are you enjoying season five?&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Is Yellowstone based on a true story?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eeF_TjW0BFMw data-wc=37>While John Dutton isn't based on a real-life person, the show's creator Taylor Sheridan has previously revealed that the drama is inspired by changes he's seen in the mountain West in states such as Montana and Wyoming.</p><p id=e9l6nrE8DBGW data-wc=47>"These issues of land development, resource mismanagement, oppression and extreme poverty and inequity in government — <strong>they exist here</strong>," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Los Angeles Times</a> in 2018. "But when it happens in a small area, in a rural area … and because there’s fewer people, the consequences seem much more acute."</p><p id=ett9cF6_gRGC data-wc=28>He continued: "When you start seeing Costcos in a landscape of farms and ranches, it's much more dramatic than if they jam one in the San Fernando Valley."</p><p id=eCBl_-d4ZpNb data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone star Kelsey Asbille is dating a VERY famous British actor</a></strong></p><p id=elDrBfkcDX3L data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Yellowstone season 5's return and will there be season 6?</a></strong></p><p id=eByKWT6vKH7D data-wc=67>Taylor also said that the show is inspired by the "gentrification" of the West. "<strong>It is the most American of us, the West, and land developers sell that fantasy</strong>," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Deadline</a> back in 2018. "And people who can afford the fantasy are very, very wealthy people from LA to New York, Dallas and Florida. They buy their slice of it and use it for a weekend getaway."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9363f5fd142e-yellowstone-kevin-kelly-z.jpg><p id=eqiar31qgqQ0 data-wc=5><strong>Kevin stars alongside Kelly Reilly</strong></p><p id=e8iJi29I-1lW data-wc=50>Kevin Costner, who plays the Dutton patriarch, also took inspiration from his own life in preparation for the role.

The [Winchester] .30-30 gun I use in the show was his. When I put it up to my cheek, my dad’s right there.
