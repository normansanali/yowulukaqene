The couple has been jumping in and out of their romance for years, but after last year's infamous "Cucumber Party," Reginae announced that she was finished with the rapper. Still, he would hint that he&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">missed her and loved her,</a> all the while other stars like YK Osiris and NBA YoungBoy were shooting their shot at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a>'s daughter.</p><p>Prince Williams / Contributor / Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">YFN Lucci opened up about his relationship with Reginae while speaking with Angela Yee for her Fox Soul show. The rapper said he wasn't worried about other artists expressing interest in his&nbsp;leading lady&nbsp;while they weren't together because that comes with the territory. Angela told him, "She loves you, though," to which Lucci replied, "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I love her ass, too.</a>" Angela then asked, "So, you think that she's the one?"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lucci laughed and said, "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">We cool, man</a>. Next subject, what's up." He also didn't confirm that they were back together, but he said that they were working on their relationship because they can be toxic. Apparently, Reginae and Lucci are trying to get to a place where they just enjoy each other like they were when they first got together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Additionally, Lucci has four childrenâ€”two of which are three-years-old from different women. "Ghetto twins," he called them. "I had two girls pregnant at the same time, but these were my first baby mamas." He has two children with two women, and the mothers of his kids may not get along with Reginae. Lucci said that his kids love Carter, but as far as Reginae's relationship with the mothers goes: "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">We working on it</a>."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Watch Lucci talk about his feelings for Reginae below.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
