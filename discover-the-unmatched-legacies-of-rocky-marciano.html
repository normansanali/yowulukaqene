He is considered one of the greatest professional boxers of all time. Rocky Marciano participated from 1947 to 1955.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What are some of the legacies of Rocky Marciano?</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Rocky Marciano</a> and heavyweight Brian Nielsen share the record for the longest undefeated streak by a heavyweight. He is also the only world heavyweight champion to remain unbeaten during his professional career. Although heavyweight champion Gene Tunney never lost a heavyweight bout and retired as champion, he did lose one light heavyweight fight and had a 32-match win streak. His overall record was 82-1-4(D)-1(NC).</p><p>Marciano also boasts the best knockout percentage of any heavyweight champion in history (during the course of their career), with 87.76%. Only twice in his professional career has he been knocked down. The first came in his debut title fight against Jersey Joe Walcott, and the second was against Archie Moore.</p><p>Despite his flawless record and retirement as champion, Marciano has occasionally been chastised for the apparently inferior quality of opposition he faced throughout his career.[40] Some commentators claimed that during his first bout with Roland La Starza, La Starza, rather than Marciano, deserved the verdict.</p><p>Despite these concerns, Marciano has been placed high on various all-time boxing lists. A survey of 40 boxing experts conducted by The Ring in December 1962 ranked Marciano as the seventh-best heavyweight of all time. In 1968, boxing historian Charlie Rose regarded Marciano as the eighth-best heavyweight of all time, while John McCallumâ€™s survey of boxing historians and journalists ranked him ninth-best all-time in the category.</p><p>Nat Fleischer, a boxing historian and The Ring founder ranked Marciano as the tenth greatest heavyweight champion of all time in 1971.</p><p>In 1998, The Ring named Marciano the sixth greatest heavyweight champion of all time. In 2002, The Ring ranked him number 12 on its list of the 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years. Marciano was ranked 14th among the top 100 punchers of all time by The Ring in 2003. In 2005, the International Boxing Research Organization ranked him as the sixth greatest heavyweight of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp2grJufq7KzedOhnGatnqKuta%2FHnptmpJWcrqS1xKxkqJ5dp7ykt9hmpJqqk56ur7uO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
