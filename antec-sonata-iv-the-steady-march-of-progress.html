I've built machines in every model from Antec's main Sonata range; my dad's computer is in an old Sonata, my ex-girlfriend's computer is in my old Sonata II, and a close friend's machine is purring along in a Sonata III. As a result, it's a chance to see how Antec's design has evolved over time. But it's more than that: the Sonata line has for a long time been a go-to for quiet computing with reasonable thermals. Has that changed with the Sonata IV?</p><p align=center><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/4440/s-glamour.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At first glance, the Sonata IV looks an awful lot like the Sonata III but a little bit larger and with the ventilation changed around. For the Sonata IV, Antec seems to have relaxed their less-is-more approach a little bit in a bid to get with the times. While power consumption of mainstream desktop machines hasn't grown tremendously over the past few years, each successive generation of Sonata has seen a more substantial power supply included with it. The Sonata II's was rated at 420 watts and the Sonata III's at 500W - still more than enough for most modern systems. The Sonata IV ratchets things up to a 620W Antec Neo ECO, 80 Plus certified. It's an awful lot of power for what's otherwise a relatively modest enclosure.</p><table align=center border=1 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=550><tbody readability=7.8358208955224><tr readability=2><td align=center class=contentwhite colspan=3><strong>Antec Sonata IV Specifications</strong></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Motherboard Form Factor</strong></td><td>ATX, Micro ATX, Mini ITX</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=2><strong>Drive Bays</strong></td><td><strong>External</strong></td><td>3x 5.25"</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internal</strong></td><td>4x 3.5", 1x 2.5"</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=5><strong>Cooling</strong></td><td><strong>Front</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Rear</strong></td><td>1x 120mm Antec TriCool exhaust fan</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Top</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Side</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Bottom</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Expansion Slots</strong></td><td>7</td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2><strong>Front I/O Port</strong></td><td>2x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.0, mic and headphone jacks</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Top I/O Port</strong></td><td>-</td></tr><tr readability=2><td colspan=2><strong>Power Supply Size</strong></td><td>ATX; 620-watt Antec Neo ECO 80 Plus power supply included</td></tr><tr readability=4><td colspan=2><strong>Clearance</strong></td><td>11" (Expansion Cards), 180mm (CPU HSF), 260mm (PSU)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Weight</strong></td><td>21.1 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><strong>Dimensions</strong></td><td>18.9" x 8.1" x 17.3"</td></tr><tr readability=1.45><td colspan=2><strong>Price</strong></td><td>$160 MSRP; starting at <a href=#>$131 online</a></td></tr></tbody></table><p>What's not immediately obvious here is that Antec has physically expanded the Sonata IV's dimensions a bit from its predecessors as well. The Sonata III was a fine case, but getting a video card like the ATI Radeon HD 5870 in was extremely difficult; the back end of the card butts up squarely against the hard drive trays. The IV is about half an inch longer and taller, though width remains unchanged.</p><p>Another thing that has expanded but unfortunately in exactly the wrong way is the price tag: part of the appeal of the earlier models was that they were good cases with good power supplies for a good price. They tended to top out at $120 in retail stores, could be found for about $100 if you knew where to look, and were a great one-stop for a quick and easy build. At an MSRP of $159, though, the Sonata IV stops being an intriguing value proposition and starts to compete against enthusiast enclosures like the Corsair Graphite 600T and even Antec's own P183.</p><p>We can currently find the previous generation Sonata III for $114, compared to $131 for the Sonata IV, so mostly you're paying $17 extra to move from a 500W PSU to a 620W 80 Plus PSU. That's a fair proposition, but as noted we used to see the III going for closer to $100 online, so $30 for the PSU upgrade becomes a somewhat questionable value.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIF1gI9omKeslZh6tLvNmquaZZmrerW0xGaqrZ2RmcZuucCrmqFln5t6sb7OoKmeq6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
