Appearing on The View Tuesday to advance his as of late released journal The Book of Jose, have Ana Navarro — who shared an embrace with the rapper as he walked out, noting they’ve known each other for some time — celebrated that Fat Joe has the “most beautiful family.”</p><p>“You live for them,” she said, listing Joe’s better half Lorena, daughter Azariah, 16 — “who has you wrapped around her little finger,” Navarro kidded — and sons Ryan, 26, and Joey, 32.</p><p>Speaking about son Joey, who lives with autism, the rapper talked about including his son’s story in his journal.</p><p>“My entire book is a book of transparency,” he shared. “It’s about failures, it’s about wins. It’s about going through dark times and knowing you can grin at the end.”</p><p>Explaining that he’s “so pleased” of Joey, he celebrated him as the “Don of the family.”</p><p>“He inspires me. He’s such a blessing in our life, he’s almost similar to an angel,” said the rapper. “The gift continues to give, little Joey, and I’m so pleased with him.” Fat Joe, who raised Joey as a single father from the age of 19 with the assistance of his parents until the hour of his marriage, pondered his fatherhood process while celebrating Joey’s birthday last December.<br><br>“How would you let someone know who’s given you such a lot of happiness in life thank you???. How would you tell your best companion and most loyal one thank you??.</p><p>I am so glad for Joey he’s my heart and soul,” the “All The Way Up” rapper shared.</p><p>“I love you Joey, we as a whole love you Joey, thank you for being my Biggest blessing throughout everyday life! 🙏🏽💙Happy Birthday Joey, God favor you,” he composed.</p><p>Appearing on the A&E series Origins of Hip Bounce earlier this year, the rapper talked about his better half Lorena, whom he marry in 1995.</p><p>“We made an oath,” the hitmaker said. “We said, ‘Regardless of what comes our way, we’re gonna always be together.’</p><p>We live by that standard. We want to show our kin that you can be a family man. You can be with your significant other and still find success and show individuals a great example.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcLGrqCdnaSeuqZ6wqikaKiVpL2tsY6fmK1lmqSybrvPnqWsZaWleqKuzq6rZqCfrHq0u81mrqKsmGKutsDIrKRmoZ6ovaq%2BxKxkoaGdYrWmv4ysrJygXZZ6o7jErKqippditq95zq6pZqSZm7JugJdtbHFsXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
