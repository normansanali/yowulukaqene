Tragically, her life was cut short a few years after she appeared in the dating competition. On January 9, 2020, <a href=#>TMZ</a> reported that police received an early morning call for a young woman in cardiac arrest. The 23-year-old was found dead at the West Virginia home.</p><p dir=ltr>Her grandmother, Carol Efaw, later revealed Eddy's cause of death to&nbsp;<a href=#>Radar</a>. "It was an OD," she told the outlet. "She caught a hold of it again." Efaw blamed "Are You The One?" for exacerbating Eddy's struggles, telling the outlet "those shows mess up kids." She added, "My son and daughter-in-law are devastated."</p><p dir=ltr>Eddy had often shared about her recovery on social media, and in September 2019, she posted a <a href=#>photo</a> of her and her dad. "Here's the first picture of my father and me, both sober and healthy, we've ever been blessed enough to take," she wrote. "Overwhelmed with gratefulness today." She added the hashtag #RecoveryRocks. Shortly before that, Eddy posted a <a href=#>photo</a> outside of a Community Recovery Center and added the caption, "Recovery at its finest <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wp.looper.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif alt=;) style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Gr8ful 2 b clean & sober #justfortoday." So it was obviously very important to her.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or anyone you know needs help with addiction issues, help is available.
