And Entitled to Free Agency Over My Body Like Everyone Else!! Thank you 2019 🎉🎉🎉! Its Going to Be an amazing Year!! 🔥🔥🔥! #2019 #freedom#respect #nofear #nodiscrimination,” the pop icon wrote.</p><p>The theory that the 60-year-old singer had physically enhanced her buttocks with plastic surgery came after a video of her surprise New Year’s Eve performance at NYC’s Stonewall Inn — and screen grabs showing a potentially enhanced hiny in tight black pants — went viral.</p><p>While the “Like a Prayer” singer’s latest Instagram post seems to address body-shaming trolls, fans immediately noticed she didn’t flat-out deny obtaining a rounder rear-end. “Your body, your rules, you are what you are now,” wrote one.
