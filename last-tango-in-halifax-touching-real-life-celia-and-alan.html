The series follows Alan and Celia, two schoolmates who haven't seen one another for almost 60 years, but who fall in love and get married in their 70s. Sally revealed that the show was inspired by her own mother, who married an old school friend after reconnecting with him on Friends Reunited.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebPApkdaTCJj data-wc=8><strong>WATCH: Last Tango in Halifax series five trailer</strong></p><p id=e4f0m4wZHgcU data-wc=88>Chatting at a Q&A, she explained: "It was based on what happened to my mum. She got married again at 75 to this guy. My dad died and my sister put her on Friends Reunited and she got in touch with two people from her class - she was 73 at this point. Alec Walker got in touch with her and they meet up and had tea - and it turned out that he always had a bit of a crush on her when they were at school."&nbsp;</p><p id=escH_ElGNRN0 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Indiana Bones and James Bond: James King's Week in Movies</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f137a58573f8-celia-alan-z.jpg><p id=eA5rH4CFnb3C data-wc=13><strong>Celia and Alan were based on Sally's mother Dorothy and her husband Alec</strong></p><p id=esm63Q2eTvkO data-wc=107>She continued: "Unlike the story, my mum didn't have a crush on him, she couldn't quite remember who he was! But then she did fall in love with him. They absolutely fell in love with each other at 75. It was really uplifting and beautiful and extraordinary. But they were very different. He was a really, genuinely lovely man. But that's where good drama comes from, complex people." Alec sadly passed away in 2009, and Sally told the Daily Mail that her mother, Dorothy, now has dementia - but that she loved watching the show and was a huge fan of the character based on her, Celia.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3758f9585a55-last-tango-ted-z.jpg><p id=e6J9lHE8y1av data-wc=8><strong>Derek Jacobi and Anne Reid play the Buttershaws</strong></p><p id=eGak19R5kuzb data-wc=50>She said: "She was thrilled about it. She loved Celia. Like Celia, Mum called a spade a spade. But she was so proud of Last Tango because it was such a beautiful story and she felt, like I did, that falling in love at 75 was something to be celebrated."&nbsp;</p><p id=educRVWJajPB data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Last Tango in Halifax star reveals Alan and Celia's marriage troubles</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2toYGd%2FdISUam1sZ5yWwLV505qloKddnrtutMCloJ%2BZqGLBsMHCoaCnn12nsqK4jKWgn51dmLKttcBmmKecXZa5orqO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
