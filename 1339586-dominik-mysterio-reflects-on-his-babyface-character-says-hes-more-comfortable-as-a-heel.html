Rey and Dominik won the SmackDown Tag Team Championship together, but the young star eventually turned on his father at WWE Clash at the Castle 2022. In doing so, he joined the villainous stable, and he has continued to shine with the group.</p><p>Speaking on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Keepin It 100 with Konnan</a>, Dominik was asked whether he’s more comfortable as a heel. He responded by explaining how he felt like his babyface character was an overexaggerated version of himself, as he had to match his dad’s energy and keep smiling. He then noted that he has more options with what he can do as a heel, so he does feel more comfortable. Dominik also noted that, when he used to train ahead of his debut, he worked as a heel, so the transition was particularly natural.</p><p>“I think so. I think for me, when I first started with my dad, it just seemed like an overexaggerated version of me, because I’m very laid back and very calm, and I just felt like I had to match my dad’s energy, so it was always smiling,” Dominik said. “They were like, ‘Dude, you got a good smile. Smile.’ I felt like I just had more options and more variety to play with as a heel. I did feel a lot more comfortable.</p><p>“Plus, when I was training, before I debuted, when I would do matches, I would always be the bad guy, I would always be the heel, working the babyface in training. So it kind of just came a little bit more natural and comfortable for me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJscG5wZmKxsLnIp6CkZZ2uwLWx0aKmZqqVm7mmr9OsZKimXZ22tHnBmpmynpGYsm6vx5qpmpukmr9uv8Cyqmaglah6rrvRnmScp52bvLPAwJujnmWRqHqieceenKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
