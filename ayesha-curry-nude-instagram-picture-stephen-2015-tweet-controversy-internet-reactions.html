One user on Instagram commented, “Steph. You better get ahold of that. She's gett'n outta hand.lol.” Another said, “What happened to being modest and keeping goods only for your husband?”</p><p>The next one posted, “Didn’t you go off a couple years ago about being modest?” One user shared, “Maybe now she gonna get the attention she want from other men lol.” Another stated, “With all due respect what are you advertising here?” One added, “Let me log into my other account and like this pic ik how much u want attention.”</p><p>One user asked, "Is this the same person that was telling women to cover up a few years ago?"&nbsp;"Never did that," she defended and agreed with another user who claimed that she is covered up in the photo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/efdf5a65-322f-4ec2-8b5b-9b71c530a9c8.1068530612> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7d4a3749-747f-402f-aec5-bfc7350a37bc.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/d05f13ef-c07a-4307-a478-771428eebcb9.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/5b613c2e-ca3c-47f3-9e86-130e27643e3b.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/3c2183d8-3c18-4b13-912e-5dfad7eaaa35.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/e1e334f4-ec10-4fa1-996a-437c28a323ce.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/2409d009-bae4-4262-8597-720c97679303.JPG><h2 class=split>‘Person wearing nipple pasties leaving a Starbucks’</h2><p>After getting slammed on Instagram, Ayesha decided to give it back to the haters. According to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Buzzfeed</a>, the Canadian citizen while referring to her 2015 controversial tweet, reverted to a troll saying, “When you realize I was talking about a person wearing nipple pasties leaving a Starbucks and thought it was hilarious… but no one cared to ask.”</p><p>She also made it clear to another troll that she “never” told women to cover themselves referring to her old tweet. When one user said, “I smell divorce,” as reported by the same publication, she replied with sharp sarcasm, “You must have covid. Or didn’t read the caption, but go off.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8da63ed7-11f1-48db-8e8a-1cdff4f9f797.JPG> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/93fa99bf-19e9-4141-ad7a-5872284df6c0.JPG><p>This is not the first time that Ayesha has stirred up controversy. Her fans called her out in May 2020 for trying to fish for other men's attention after she posted a <a href=#>bikini picture</a>. The photo in question had the actress dressed down in a grey bikini, looking sultrily at the camera while she holds up her hair with both hands. "Took me long enough," read her caption which we guess she was referring to a long time since she posted a bikini photo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomamawKmtjJysq6qpYru2sMRmoKerpJa0s63MZqeim6Sqv6Z50q2cqaCVo3pzfJBuZK2vlZrBbq%2FOp6urp6aav7TFjKKlrZ2io7K1edGemJysmaS7tA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
