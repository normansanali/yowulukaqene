He had been suffering from pancreatic cancer at the time. His son Nathen posted a tribute to his father on his Instagram.</p><p>"I love you so much papa," Nathen wrote on Tuesday. "Rest In Peace and I'm so glad you got to share all your adventures with me and were able to accomplish so much. I'm so proud of you. I will always love you, but I think it's time for you to go on an adventure of your own."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You'll always be with me," he continued. "Love you more than you will ever know and I'm glad you can be at peace now. You always were the toughest and funniest and smartest person I've known. I'm glad you shared [your] love with me. I'll never forget it or lose it."</p><p>Garson, who identified as straight, won legions of fans in the LGBTQ+ community playing the ever-enthusiastic, generous gay best friend of <a href=#>Carrie Bradshaw</a>.</p><p>"I didn't want to offend the community at all, and that was a really big concern of mine...," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Huffington Post</a> in 2016. "But, the gay community really rose up, and said ‘we know people like this, this is real.' And so that made me feel great."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was also very important to the show, to show someone having fun being gay, being proud, open, and comfortable with who they are," he said.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>Related:</strong></span></p><p><a href=#>'Sex And The City' Reboot Kicks Off With Pics From Day 1 On Set</a></p><p>Fans are showing their love for the actor on Twitter, as they celebrate one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first representations</a> of a happy and fulfilled gay man portrayed on screen.</p><p>"Absolutely heartbreaking. I know he wasn’t gay in real life but his portrayal of Stanford on Sex And The City was the first time I had actually seen a positive happy portrayal of a gay man on TV & was such an inspiration for me. R.I.P. Willie Garson," wrote one devastated viewer, accompanied by a broken heart and crying emoji.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This one really hurts," wrote another. "Willie’s portrayal of Stanford captured what I’ve so often felt and struggled with as a gay youth who always felt invisible, insecure, and cast aside. But his character was always fiercely loyal, compassionate and above all, a ride-or-die friend. Thank you."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Twitter Reacts To ‘Sex And The City’ Sequel Bringing Back The Carrie & Big Drama</a></span></p><p>"In Stanford Blatch, Willie Garson took what has become a stock character and filled it with humanity, pathos, joy.
