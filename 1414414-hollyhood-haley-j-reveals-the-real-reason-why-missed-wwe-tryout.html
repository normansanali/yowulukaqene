She is the daughter of six-time Ohio Valley Wrestling Women’s Champion Amazing Maria. Fans have recently been able to see her on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>‘s new docuseries Wrestlers.</p><p>Haley J has been wrestling for several years. She began wrestling in IWA-MS at the BattleBroads special event. The young professional wrestler has also competed in a few matches in Tony Khan’s promotion, All Elite Wrestling. HollyHood competed in a couple of matches on AEW Dark and then was also a part of one of the House Rules live events. Sadly, she lost all her matches in the Jacksonville-based promotion.</p><p>Haley J has been absent from in-ring competition since September. During a recent episode of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe De Rene</a> podcast, she was a special guest. In the episode, J revealed that her doctor refuses to clear her to compete due to her epilepsy, and it’s why she also missed a recent WWE tryout opportunity.</p><p>“I have epilepsy and my doctor is not trying to clear me to wrestle. My doctor. Of course, they were like, ‘we need a clearance letter.’ My doctor was like, ‘No.’ I’m in the process of finding another doctor to get a second opinion. I haven’t had a seizure in over six years. Been off medication for four, been wrestling for almost four years, haven’t had any issues. I don’t know why they won’t work with me. Waiting on a second opinion. Then, I should be right back up at the top where I belong,”&nbsp;HollyHood Haley J said.

Getting a bunch of bookings. Some out of the country bookings, that’s cool. A lot of people ordering merch. Almost sold out of all of my merch. Got me a little tryout. It didn’t fall through. That will come back around. It got me new friends,” HollyHood Haley J said.</p><p>It is to be noted that one of Haley J’s memorable matches was against her own mother in a <a href=#>death match</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqa21pZGK1sLjLsp%2Bop5RitaK4xLJko2WimsOmrcusZK2glWK%2Fpq3LZqmemaOku27Dx7JkpqGjqLKledawnGasoq68tsA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
