In January 2014, an individual, who has since been identified and charged, illegally accessed a ReverbNation vendor’s computer systems and ultimately gained unauthorized access to user information contained in a backup of our database.<br></p><p><br>No credit card data of any kind was accessed. ReverbNation never retains your credit or debit card information in our database, so that information was not exposed.ReverbNation takes data security very seriously and we have taken steps to further secure our system against any such breach.<br></p><p><br>While no credit card data was accessed, some user information included in the database such as e-mail addresses and encrypted passwords, and possibly other user information users provided to us, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and/or dates of birth may have been accessed.<br></p><p><br>Although your password was encrypted it is possible for a person with enough computing power to guess an encrypted password by testing particularly weak or obvious passwords. As a precaution, we strongly encourage you to change your ReverbNation password, as described below. You should also change your password on any other accounts or websites which share your previous ReverbNation password. For additional help with password security, we also recommend password management tools like 1Password and LastPass.<br></p><p><br>How to Change Your ReverbNation Password<br></p><p><br>1.Log in to www.reverbnation.com.<br>2.From your Dashboard, click on your profile image in the top right of the screen.<br>3.Select “Account.”<br>4.Select “Change Password” in the top right of the screen.<br>5.Enter the requested information, and click “Proceed.”<br>6.You should immediately receive a ReverbNation email notifying you of the password change.<br></p><p>For your own security, please remember to not provide personal information in response to any electronic communications regarding security breach.
