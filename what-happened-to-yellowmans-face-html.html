His life story is a remarkable tale of talent, perseverance, and triumph over hardships. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1956, Yellowman faced numerous challenges right from the start due to his genetic condition known as albinism, which affects skin pigmentation and vision. Despite enduring rejection and ignorance from his community, he was determined to make a name for himself in the music world.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3><strong>The Early Struggles</strong></h3><p>Growing up with albinism in Jamaica wasn’t easy for Yellowman.
