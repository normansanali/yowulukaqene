Brown resigned from his position.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Stemming from that, Brown was charged with eight felonies related to blackmail and identity theft after he allegedly posed as a lawyer that sent cease-and-desist letters to news outlets so they would stop reporting on the aforementioned text fiasco.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By 2021, those charges were dismissed.
