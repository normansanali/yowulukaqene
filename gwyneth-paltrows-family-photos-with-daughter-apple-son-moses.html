Son Moses was born in 2006, and Paltrow opened up about struggling with <a href=#>postpartum depression</a> soon after.</p><p>“I felt like a zombie. I couldn’t access my heart. I couldn’t access my emotions. I couldn’t connect,” she told Good Housekeeping after her son’s arrival. “It was terrible, it was the exact opposite of what had happened when Apple was born. With her, I was on cloud nine. I couldn’t believe it wasn’t the same. I just thought it meant I was a terrible mother and a terrible person.”</p><p>After 10 years of marriage, Paltrow and the “Yellow” crooner called it quits. In the now-infamous March 2014 statement, the Iron Man actress <a href=#>described the breakup as a “conscious uncoupling.”</a> She filed for divorce in April 2015, and the proceedings were finalized in July 2016.</p><p>Despite their split, the twosome committed to cordially raising their kids. “He’s really like my brother,” the <a href=#>Goop</a> founder said of Martin <a href=#>during a January 2018 interview with <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></a>. “We’re very familiar. It’s nice. I think we genuinely wanted our kids to be as unscathed as possible. And we thought, if we could really maintain the family even though we weren’t a couple, that was kind of the goal. So that’s what we’ve tried to do.”</p><p>Both the Grammy winner and the Royal Tenenbaums star moved on after the end of their marriage. Paltrow, for her part, <a href=#>tied the knot</a> with <a href=#><strong>Brad Falchuk</strong></a> in September 2018. The Glee producer shares two kids of his own with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Suzanne Bukinik</strong></a>, and he and Paltrow <a href=#>took their time moving in together</a> for the sake of their blended family.</p><p>“We each have two teenage children whom we love very much,” the Avengers: Infinity War star said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in October 2019. “We were just trying to be mindful and give them a little space and not move too quickly. Less merging originally, but <a href=#>now we’re merged</a>.”</p><p>The “Viva La Vida” singer, meanwhile, <a href=#>moved on with</a> <a href=#><strong>Dakota Johnson</strong></a> in October 2017. The Peanut Butter Falcon actress and her beau are “very friendly” with Paltrow and Falchuk, a source previously told Us.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s not without effort and having to <a href=#>put feelings aside</a> from time to time,” the insider added in October 2019. “They genuinely enjoy being together and there’s a lot of love for one another on all sides. Gwyneth loves Dakota, and vice versa. She really likes her and who she is as a person. She cares deeply for [Martin] and wants him to be happy.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Paltrow’s sweetest moments with her two kids:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktLjFzZ6roWWglrm1vs6wqmaekaK2rcWMqZ%2BorJ%2Boeri106FknZmlnLW1sdFmmKmonJp6tLvNZqSoq5WofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
