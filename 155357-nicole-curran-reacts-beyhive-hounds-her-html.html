They stormed her Instagram page, which has now been deactivated, with tons of bee emojis and verbal attacks.</p><p class=Zg>Beyoncé, 37, also seemed to stoke the controversy with a passive-aggressive move. She shared pictures and videos of her and <a class="zd d" href=#>Jay-Z</a>, 49, sitting courtside at the game and made sure to crop Curran out. Swipe left to see the cropped parts.</p><p><h3 class=dh>NICOLE'S CLAPBACK</h3></p><p class=Zg>Before turning off comments and eventually deactivating her Instagram page, Curran <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXve6rhpil/>clapped back</a> at the Beyhive trolls in a comment captured by The Shade Room:</p><p class=Zg>“Listen Beehive. I respect Queen B. I love her! I talked to her husband twice tonight. First, to take a drink order for them both when they arrived as they were our guests. Second, to explain why I gave his wife a rose from a fan. All of this has been taken out of context. I am a happily married woman. Telling me to kill myself?????? Somehow I don’t think she would support this.”</p><p class=Zg>“The fact that [Beyoncé] doesn’t say anything about how nasty her fans are makes me feel a way about her,” <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXve6rhpil/>wrote</a> an Instagram user in the comments.</p><p class=Zg>“I don’t know who needs to hear this,” <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/ByXve6rhpil/>added</a> another. “BEYONCÉ AIN’T GOD!!!!!”</p><p><h3 class=dh>NICOLE OFFERS MORE EXPLANATION</h3></p><p class=Zg>Curran later spoke with ESPN reporter Ramona Shelburne, <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1136696108355244032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1136696108355244032&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpeople.com%2Fmusic%2Fnicole-curran-reveals-what-said-jay-z-viral-game-3-moment-beyonce%2F">revealing</a> that she “had been getting death threats on social media” since the night of the incident and had to disable her Instagram account the next morning.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Photo: Twitter/Ramona Shelburne</p><p class=Zg>“Curran says Jay Z asked for a vodka soda.
