He returned to WWE after a protracted absence, mainly to participate in high-profile feuds, and became a mainstay on RAW. However, it was interesting to note a special tribute that Johnny Wrestling did for his son through the wrestling gear that he wore for the Elimination Chamber.</p><p>Johnny Gargano was a part of the Men’s Elimination Chamber match this past weekend. The grueling bout was for the WWE United States championship and saw the champion, Austin Theory, retain his title.</p><p>Despite coming up short, Triple H commended Johnny Gargano for his outstanding effort in the match at the press conference following the event. Gargano also donned a unique ring attire for the match. Quill LeRae, the son of Johnny and Candice LeRae, turned one this week, and Gargano wanted to celebrate, so he had clothing created as a tribute.</p><p>Ring gear designer Jonathan Davenport has previously created designs for WWE talents including Bayley, Big E, Ricochet, LeRae, and Gargano. He provided the intriguing backstory of the gear in a post <a href=#>on Instagram.</a></p><p>“This set was a HUGE honor to work on – earlier this week, @johnnygargano and @candicelerae ‘s son Quill had his first birthday and this SuperDad wanted to celebrate with a colorway inspired by Bluey and Bandit. My family ADORES this show so I flipped at the chance to incorporate those aesthetics into our palette!</p><p>It was Johnny’s idea to add Bandit’s whisker flecks to the dark blue fields, which I think was stroke of genius. I surprised Johnny with a ‘quill”‘ easter egg on the right kneepad just for the fun factor!</p><p>Big thanks goes out to @maineventgear for once again honoring the design while also putting their own unique spin on the set! Enjoy!⁠”</p><p><a href=#>Johnny Gargano has always been top prospect</a> for the man in charge of the WWE landscape, Triple H. We will have to wait and see what The Game has planned for Johnny Wrestling as the road to WrestleMania moves forward.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>What is your take on this story?
