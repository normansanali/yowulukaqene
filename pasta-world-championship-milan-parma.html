We moved into our new place in Chicago, almost immediately left for a whirlwind trip that took us through France and Italy, then ended back in the Midwest in Madison before heading back home. Iâ€™m eventually going to share a little bit about each trip, but for today Iâ€™m starting with the most logical place to begin â€“ the middle! Italy!</p><p class=p1>Jack and I spent 4 days in Milan and Parma at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BarillaÂ® Pasta World Championship.</a>&nbsp;Itâ€™s crazy to reflect and see where our work takes us. Eating our way through northern Italy was a blast, to say the least.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2345.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>The competition started in Milan with 19 young chefs competing, each with their signature pasta dish, for the title of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pasta World Champion.</a> Each dish was more creative and artful than the last. Look at those colors! My #1 takeaway from this event was that my pasta twirling skills definitely need some work ðŸ™‚</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2303-grid.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p>At the end of Day, 19 chefs were narrowed to 10 to compete the following day. We werenâ€™t in Milan very long, but we managed to squeeze in an evening walk to the Milan duomo and the next day, of course, some gelato time.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2451-grid.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p>On day 2 of the competition, each chef made their version of Spaghetti Pomodoro. It was fun to watch the variations that each chef made using tomato, pasta, and basil. The dish at the top of this post was my favorite (not the winner, but maybe next time theyâ€™ll let me judge, ha ha).</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2501.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2791.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p>After the competition was whittled down to 3 contestants, we headed to Parma where we strolled the picturesque cobblestone streets with fellow bloggers Gaby from <a href=#>Whatâ€™s Gaby Cooking</a> and Jenny (with her husband Jordan) from <a href=#>Spoon Fork Bacon</a>. (Not pictured, we had 2 great meals at <a href=#>La Forchetta</a> and <a href=#>Ristorante Cocchi</a>).</p><p>On day 3, each chef made their signature dish again and a winner was chosen â€“ Chef Accursio Lota the chef from San Diego (originally from Sicily) was named the Pasta World Champion. We were especially rooting for him, not just because he was representing America, but because his dad (who speaks no English) bravely stopped waiters from taking my bread away at dinner the night before.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8443.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p class=p1>The last day was the day I was waiting for â€“ the day we visited a Parmigiano Reggiano factory. Look at those rows! We also visited a balsamic producer where we tasted tiny drops of the best aged balsamic vinegar ever in Modena.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_2805.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/pasta-world-championship-milan-parma/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_8631.jpg&description=Pasta+World+Championship+in+Milan+and+Parma")'></span></span></p><p>So that was it, and we had a blast! We got to photograph and taste amazing pasta, hang out with friends and see Parmigiano Reggiano making in Parma! Plus, we canâ€™t wait to visit Chef Lotaâ€™s restaurant in San Diego and try more of his delicious pasta!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfpa60wMBmrqiqnJl6pLTApqeip56otaq8jKagpZmeYr2ivsyaZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
