After <a href=#><strong>Hannah Brown</strong></a> called off her engagement with <a href=#><strong>Jed Wyatt</strong></a>, the musician is returning to his stomping grounds at Music City Male Revue — a male burlesque club in Nashville.</p><p>“Our Labor Day Weekend show just got even hotter and no we are not talking about the weather forecast,” the Tennessee-based club <a href=#>teased via Instagram</a> on Wednesday, August 28. “Kick off your bachelorette weekend this Saturday at 4 PM with us and our very special guest @jedwyatt.”</p><p>In Music City Male Revue’s post, they shared a pic of the Bachelorette alum in a dark blue button-down shirt and blue jeans as he slightly flashed his upper chest.</p><p>According to <a href=#>the venue’s website</a>, Music City Male Revue puts on “PG” hourlong shows. The burlesque joint’s website also noted that visitors will “enjoy a fully choreographed entertainment experience with slamming music,” adding that it’s a place where a bride can bring their “soon-to-be-mother-in-law and not have to worry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jed-Wyatt-to-Dance-in-Male-Burlesque-Show-After-Hannah-Brown-Split.jpg><p>Music City Male Revue’s hired dancers are considered to be “performers, not strippers.”</p><p>Wyatt, 25, worked at the Nashville club <a href=#>briefly in 2018</a>. Though he appeared in a few commercials and was striving to become a prominent musician, the Belmont University graduate gained recognition <a href=#>upon vying for Brown’s heart</a> on <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brown, 24, chose the season 15 contender in the show’s two-part finale. However, the former pageant queen <a href=#>ended their relationship</a> after <a href=#>learning about Wyatt having a girlfriend</a>, fellow singer <strong>Haley Stevens</strong>, waiting for him back home.</p><p>During his appearance on the “Bachelor Happy Hour” podcast, Wyatt maintained that he was “not in an exclusive relationship” with Stevens.</p><p>“If you really do love someone, no matter how promising they’ve made it seem, if they’re going on a dating show, regardless of why they’re going on a dating show, why would you stay with them? If I was in a relationship, I would not have gone onto a dating show,” he said on August 2. “That’s just me. I’m not a cheater. And with my time with Haley, I did hang out with other people. I did date other people. I slept with other people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZRixLqt061koqtdp7K1wdGnoKefXam8brnApZxmmqWnuaa%2F0K6cZpucqq9uss6rZKWZkqS%2FbrDAsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
