The 32-year-old Love & Hip Hop: New York alum shared the first full photo of 10-month-old daughter <strong>Safire Majesty</strong> on Nov. 4. Prior to this, Erica and Safaree had not shown any pictures of the little one’s face on social media since <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her Feb. 2, 2020 birth</a>. Safaree teased on Oct. 27 how gorgeous their baby girl is, but Erica beat him to the punch in proving it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHMDoAWJKhV/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Safire could be seen in a leopard prink long sleeve top and leggings, and wore a matching headband with a bow around her soft, curly locks. The little one has beautiful big brown eyes that looked so expressive in the photos, along with enviable long eyelashes. Safire is already rocking some bling, as she had diamond studs in her pierced ears.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“The BEST part of 2020. My Safire Majesty,” Erica wrote in the caption. After Safaree has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hinting at a possible divorce</a>, it seemed that she might have been wanting to be the first to share a photo of their precious daughter. The 39-year-old rapper tweeted on Oct. 27, “I can’t wait for y’all to see my daughter 1 day…. she is SOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL ADORABLE CUTE…. unreal!! I know alll dads say this but she is irresistible‼️” Safaree was definitely not exaggerating about how gorgeous his only child is.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can’t wait for y’all to see my daughter 1 day…. she is SOOOOOOOO BEAUTIFUL ADORABLE CUTE…. unreal!!

Ending 2020 right!!” he wrote in the caption. Bachelor? Is that how he really wants to play things with Erica?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Safaree-Samuels-Erica-Mena-daughter-ap-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Erica had seemed to hint there was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>trouble in the marriage</a> with a cryptic IG post on Sept. 22. She wrote, “MY Kids. This is what my life is about! Priorities be really f**ked up for some people. Blessed I’m not one of those idiots.” In addition to Safire, Erica has a 13-year-old son <strong>King Conde</strong> by former boyfriend and hip hop’s <strong>Terror Squad</strong> member <strong>Raoul Conde</strong>. By that point, Erica and Safaree had unfollowed each other on social media, which is never a good sign. The couple got married on Oct. 7, 2019, just after announcing Erica’s pregnancy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH5ye49tZp6qmZiubrnEp5hmaaOperG1wmabmq2XncGmvoysmJ%2Bhopp6tK3FmqmenV2orq7BxKWqZqugoba1edGupKiqo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
