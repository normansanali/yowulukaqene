In a development as shocking as it was jaw-dropping, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher </a></strong>has decided to recast its lead role once the third season drops at some point next year, and we’d be selling it short to say folks are pissed.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Being a huge fan of the source material and video games, Cavill is well-versed in the lore of the Continent, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">something he’s brought to his performance since day one</a>. As a result, those familiar with the mythology have praised the actor for being a pitch-perfect Geralt, while his gruffly charismatic demeanor and handiness with a sword has won over a legion of new converts.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=709 data-injectable=true>Not to state the obvious, but Liam Hemsworth is most definitely not Henry Cavill, and nor does anybody want him to be. In fact, the youngest of the unfairly handsome sibling trio might want to stay away from social media and the internet in general, because he’s being absolutely torn to shreds by furious Witcher fanatics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Unless Liam Hemsworth has serious charm and acting chops that have not yet manifested on screen, Henry Cavill > Liam Hemsworth as Geralt is one of the biggest downgrade recastings I've ever heard of</p>— ViewerAnon (@ViewerAnon) <a href=#>October 29, 2022</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>In a world of awful decisions.
