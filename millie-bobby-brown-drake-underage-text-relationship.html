"I love Drake! He is amazing. This moment was amazing. I was in his dressing room with my whole family.... I was like, 'Just want to say hi.' He was like, 'Oh, my god.' He was having a fanboy moment; I was having a fangirl moment and a Drake moment."</p><p>The <strong>two appear to have remained in close contact after their first meeting</strong>, with Brown revealing to Access Hollywood in 2018 that she and the 'Hotline Bling' rapper regularly exchange text messages.</p><p>"[Drake’s] honestly so fantastic; a great friend and a great role model. We text. We just texted each other the other day and he was like, 'I miss you so much,' and I was like 'I miss you more.’ He's coming to Atlanta and I'm definitely going to go and see him.

This is all types of wrong,” one fan commented on YouTube.</p><p>Others found it rather <strong>concerning that the rapper was getting involved in Brown's dating life</strong>.</p><p>“Not only is texting a 13-year-old weird, but also giving them relationship advice just takes it to another level,” one fan commented.</p><p>“Drake is such a weirdo. can never seem to keep a stable relationship going but has these friendships with teenagers half his age. she's 14, what a creep,” yet another fan weighed in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The criticism hit its peak during Drake's rap battle with Kendrick Lamar. In the explosive diss track, ‘Not Like Us’, <strong>Lamar accuses the Canadian-born rapper of inappropriate behavior with underage girls</strong>.</p><p>“Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young/ You better not ever go to cell block one/ To any bitch that talk to him and they in love/ Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him… Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophile… Trying to strike a chord, and it’s probably A-minor.”</p><p>Although Lamar didn't directly name anyone, <strong>Drake made a specific reference to Millie Bobby Brown in his response track</strong>, ‘The Heart Part 6.’</p><p>“I never been with no one underage but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with/ Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected/ If I was f***ing young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested/ I'm way too famous for this s**t you just suggested… Only f***in' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:06</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/drake-s-diss-tracks-reveal-his-biggest-celebrity-feuds-here-s-the-definitive-history1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Drake's Diss Tracks Reveal His Biggest Celebrity Feuds, Here's The Definitive History">Drake's Diss Tracks Reveal His Biggest Celebrity Feuds, Here's The Definitive History</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Drake has a long history of getting into beefs with many of the most notable rappers of his generation.</p><p>Lamar's diss track and Drake's response reignited criticism surrounding the 'One Dance' rapper's friendship with Millie Bobby Brown. Many <strong>fans continue to find it inappropriate that Drake was involved with someone 17 years his junior </strong>while she was still in her early teens.</p><p>“A 30+ yo man texting a kid under 18 is bad no matter how you try to sugar coat it," one Reddit user weighed in in May 2024. "Even if it’s platonic it’s still a bad look. He should have the discretion and worldliness to understand this. So either he’s extremely immature or worst case he’s low key a lech. Considering he’s done it with other young girls I’d say it’s a bit of both.”</p><h2 id=millie-bobby-brown-and-drake-have-defended-their-unlikely-friendship>Millie Bobby Brown And Drake Have Defended Their Unlikely Friendship</h2><p>Drake and Millie Bobby Brown <strong>have staunchly defended their connection </strong>against widespread criticism.
