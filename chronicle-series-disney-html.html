Our <a href=#>trusted and proven</a> sources tell us the House of Mouse is developing a Chronicle TV series.</p><p>Details about the Chronicle series remain sparse, though presumably the show is being developed to stream on <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Disney data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Disney</a>+. We don’t know if the show is being conceived as a continuation of the story presented in the 2012 film or some kind of reboot. However it’s possible one of the film’s producers supplied a hint a couple of years ago.</p><p><strong>We’ve exclusively learned a Chronicle TV series is in the works at Disney.</strong></p><p>In 2021, <a href=#>Forbes</a> spoke with John Davis who at the time was helping to promote Jungle Cruise. Davis was a producer on both Jungle Cruise and Chronicle, and while he made no mention of a series, he did say a Chronicle sequel was in development. The follow-up, he said, would be female-led and would examine subjects of “fake news and real news and cover-ups.”</p><p>He also said the sequel would be situated in the same narrative as the original, with ten years having passed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dane-dehaan-chronicle-900x506.jpg><p>It’s only speculation, but it’s possible the news received from our sources is a sign that what Davis had envisioned as a Chronicle 2 movie has since evolved into a <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=streaming data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>streaming</a> series.</p><p>One of the biggest questions about the Chronicle series is whether or not the guy who came up with the concept, Josh Trank, will have anything to do with the show. We can’t say for sure, but the possibility would seem slim for different reasons.</p><p><strong>Against a modest production budget of $15 million, Chronicle made $127 million at the box office.</strong></p><p>For one, Trank has expressed distaste at the idea of a follow-up to Chronicle. For another, the twin failures of Trank’s only other feature directorial efforts to date — 2015’s Fantastic Four and 2020’s Capone — have not exactly left him as the most sought out filmmaker in Hollywood.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-chronicle-movie><strong>The Chronicle Movie</strong></h3><p>Four months before the wide release of <a href=#>Avengers</a> and three years before Trank’s career would become marred by the Fantastic Four reboot, his feature directorial debut of Chronicle was a smashing success.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/dane-dehaan-chronicle-2-900x506.jpg><p>The film combined a superhero origin story with science fiction, found footage, and teen angst. We don’t know yet whether or not the Chronicle series will also be filmed in the found footage style.</p><p>Among others, the film starred actors who would soon feature in much bigger superhero projects: Michael B. Jordan (Black Panther) and Dane DeHaan (The Amazing <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Spider-Man data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Spider-Man</a> 2).</p><p>Alex Russell (Carrie), Jordan, and DeHaan starred as three teens who gain powerful telekinetic abilities after contact with a strange crystalline structure they discover in the woods.</p><p>Against a modest production budget of $15 million, Chronicle made $127 million at the box office. No doubt Disney — particularly in light of their recent cinematic and streaming failures — are looking for a similar return on their Chronicle series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ibmKe8r7XCpZxmq5Wntqa%2FjJ2grKaVrnupwMyl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
