After many different <a href=#>Barbies</a> and Barbie-makers (otherwise known as writers), we are almost at the finish line to watch <a href=#>Greta Gerwig</a>’s Barbie. But before watching the final product, it doesn’t hurt to think about what could’ve been — it’s better than thinking about <a href=#>dying</a>. Juno writer <a href=#>Diablo Cody</a> reminisced on her time working on the film and, through the years, gained an understanding of what went wrong. “I think I know why I shit the bed,” Cody explained to <a href=#>GQ</a>. “When I was first hired for this, I don’t think the culture had not embraced the femme or the bimbo as valid feminist archetypes yet. If you look up ‘Barbie’ on TikTok, you’ll find this wonderful subculture that celebrates the feminine, but in 2014, taking this skinny blonde white doll and making her into a heroine was a tall order.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clju703hz000s3b6xvwh89lmu@published data-word-count=116>After first Barbie writer Jenny Bicks left the project, Cody signed onto the movie in 2015 for rewrites, joining Sony’s Amy Pascal. But despite reports that Sony Pictures was unhappy with her attempt at creating a Barbie world, she said her world was never officially submitted. “Dude, I never even produced an initial draft. I failed so hard at that project. I was literally incapable of writing a Barbie script. God knows I tried,” she told<a href=#> ScreenCrush</a> in 2018, noting that she’s “always had trouble” with adaptations. However, Cody wasn’t the only writer competing to get the job done; by the end of 2015, <a href=#>three other writers</a> were reportedly signed on to draft scripts as well.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clju70tdh00133b6xmeuz2qcd@published data-word-count=108>Even though Cody officially left the project in 2018, she is still excited to watch the film. She called the film “my&nbsp;Joker,” referencing the <a href=#>meme</a> of people becoming obsessed with a film in a way that Joker fans were obsessed with, well, the Joker. But don’t expect Cody to try for any more adaptations anytime soon. “Ultimately, you’re selling toys,” she shared. “I mean, nobody really wants to delve deeper into the lore and mythos of <a href=#>Hungry Hungry Hippos</a>. That’s not really an artistic exercise.” Okay, but whatever writer can figure out a compelling Hungry Hungry Hippos movie will earn a Best Picture nomination at the very least.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cliq4b6nw00000iao1tu4c1i9@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Amy Schumer on Why She Left the Barbie Movie</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl1zgxr9n0000x1n81267wdyl@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Breaking: Barbie Has Entered the Real World</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cljsp13g1000l0ih27es5qunv@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The Dawn of Barbenheimer</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Juno’s Diablo Cody Knows Why Her Barbie Movie Didn’t Work</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlpbGdgbHyltcCbo6hlk6SxunnBmqmboZViurDCyJ5loaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
