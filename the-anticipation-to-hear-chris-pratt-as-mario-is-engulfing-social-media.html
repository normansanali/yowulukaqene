Movie</a></strong>. That skepticism remains today, but morbid curiosity has many waiting in anticipation to finally hear the actor‚Äôs attempt at the classic Mario voice to determine whether or not it will be the train wreck they imagine. With less than two days until the teaser trailer for the yet-to-be-titled film drops, people are going mad on Twitter.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=509 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>The film has an interesting cast of comedic actors ‚Äì well you didn‚Äôt expect it to be a drama now did you? Alongside Pratt is Jack Black playing the villainous Bowser, Seth Rogan as Donkey Kong, and Charlie Day as Luigi, probably the only one in the cast to claim any Italian heritage. Joining them is also Anna Taylor-Joy and Princess Peach and Michael Keegan as Toad. Casting Pratt as Mario <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">had many raising an eyebrow</a> as they simply cannot imagine the Guardians of the Galaxy actor in the role.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>In a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweet posted by the actor almost a full year ago he ‚Äúteased‚Äù his Mario voice</a>, which was of course a joke to throw us all off, for better or for worse the actor wanted us to sweat it out for a year. Without any knowledge as to how Pratt will pull off the high-pitched, over-the-top Italian accent, many are anxiously awaiting the trailer release.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Less than a week until we finally see Chris Pratt Mario <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QUaE2aZZON</a></p>‚Äî Colin (@IntroSpecktive) <a href=#>September 30, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=71 data-current-count=71 data-injectable=false>Though fans are blown away by the poster, it is a bittersweet feeling.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>It‚Äôs looks phenomenal and then we have to hear Chris pratt‚Äôs voice come out of Mario‚Äôs mouth üò≠ <a href=#>https://t.co/WQ3hPzGAeG</a></p>‚Äî Descendant of HHN Destruction (@hecallsmePP) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Though the poster has given some a flicker of hope since the news Pratt would play the iconic plumber.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>[seeing chris pratt] lmao. what a stupid idea. i cant believe they did this</p><p>[seeing the first poster] the mario movie is going to make three trillion dollars</p>‚Äî yuuko from nichijou (@headfallsoff) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=37 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Maybe not enough for everyone though.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>this poster got me optimistic as fuck and then i remembered that chris pratt's voice is gonna be coming out of him <a href=#>https://t.co/KYjnd7Lb0I</a></p>‚Äî Cat (@CatalystNB) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=68 data-current-count=68 data-injectable=false>Some are imagining the coming day as some sort of cataclysmic event.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>the second chris pratt mario opens his mouth in the trailer being on here is going to be a combination of the day the queen died and the day the cats trailer dropped</p>‚Äî James Whitbrook (@Jwhitbrook) <a href=#>September 26, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>This user feels like hearing Pratt‚Äôs Mario voice is just one more tragic thing to add to the already bleak world.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>A lonely, damaged, hopeless nation braces itself to hear Chris Pratt's Mario voice</p>‚Äî Chris Evangelista (@cevangelista413) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=426 data-injectable=true>Some are already theorising that the actor won‚Äôt even stick with the voice throughout and it will be a complete fob off.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>You know for a fact Chris Pratt is going to do the ‚ÄúHere we gooo!‚Äù In Mario‚Äôs voice and then cough awkwardly, then switch to his Chris Pratt voice<br>I hate that that‚Äôs 99% surely going to happen <a href=#>https://t.co/XiuStEIaQ9</a></p>‚Äî Boonder üëªüéÉAdult Voice Actress‚ú® (@CinderDryadVA) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>But not to worry, Jack Black is also in it, and for some that might be enough to redeem the film overall.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Man everyone is talking about Chris Pratt and his Mario voice, I'm over here just want to see Jack Black as Bowser brings out a saxophone. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FQPg6jrPfS</a></p>‚Äî FG‚Ä¶?ü¶ë (@Sleepy_FG) <a href=#>October 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=false>Fears may be confirmed or surprise relief may be had when the trailer is released on Oct. 6.
