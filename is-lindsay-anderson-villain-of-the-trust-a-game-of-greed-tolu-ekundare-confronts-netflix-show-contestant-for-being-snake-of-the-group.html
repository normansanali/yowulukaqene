I would've never did that to you."</p><p>During the , Netflix show host Brooke Baldwin asked Tolu whom she wanted to vote out, she took Lindsay saying, "You gotta cut the head of the snake, right?"</p><p>The contestant elaborated on her decision, "Lindsay would go hang out with the other individuals in the house and gather information, then come and whisper it in our ear and at the same time, she would gather info from us and whisper it in their ear. Lindsay is been the biggest snake in the house."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/513b08f9-11de-4581-9a05-9a37b66c92e1.png><p><b>Also Read</b>:</p><h2 class=split>Winnie Ilesso calls out Lindsay Anderson for playing games</h2><p>Winnie Ilesso ranted against Lindsay Anderson just before the Trust ceremony.

But I just wanted to lay everything out on the table."</p><p>Winnie then claimed that Lindsay was behind every elimination which seemed to be quite true as she was the one who voted out Juelz Morgan and Bryce Lee and never told anyone about that.</p><p>Winnie noted, "You have single-handedly had a hand at everybody that has went home and I don't know if you've told them or not, but you single-handedly had a hand in everyone going home."</p><p>Tolu Ekundare chimed in and said, "For you to look in our face and know that you've had an undercover motive the entire time is terrifying and you'll, yeah, she shared some stuff from this side of the camp with you guys, but trust and believe, that has also gone both ways."</p><p>She tried to convince other contestants to vote out Lindsay and said, "She'll come and 'Let me go talk to the boys, let me see what they're up to. Oh God! What should we do? What are the plans of attack?'"</p><p>She added, "And then, in the same breath, you're running around and spewing venom?"</p><p>However, Tolu failed to convince other , which ultimately saved Lindsay, at least for now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/48947e0c-7670-4d7a-8330-0e790ac83bda.png><h2 class=split>Will Lindsay Anderson be eliminated in 'The Trust: A Game of Greed'?</h2><p>After &nbsp;and Winnie Ilesso exposed&nbsp;Lindsay Anderson, other contestants also started suspecting her motives.

I could live with that."</p><p>After the eviction, Lindsay said, "I knew it was a risk. It was a pleasure meeting all of you guys."</p><p>She then expressed her feelings in the confessional and said, "I'm shocked. I thought Brian, Jake and Gaspate had my back.
