We sort of went through difficult times at the same time together and were each other’s confidants. It was a really nice season. Difficult for both of us, but we’re really really grateful that we had each other.”</p><p class=p3>Slater was partnered with Umansky, 53, for season 32 of the ballroom dancing competition. At the time, he was newly separated from wife <strong>Kyle Richards</strong>. Slater, meanwhile, was <a href=#>previously married</a> to fellow <i>DWTS </i>pro <strong>Sasha Farber</strong> and filed for divorce in February 2023. (<i>DWTS </i>season 32 rehearsals started the following summer, but it’s not clear if her “difficult” journey was related to the divorce.)</p><p class=p3>“You get really close to your partners on the season,” Slater told <i>Us </i>on Friday. “He’s such an amazing person. We have such a good friendship that it meant a lot that he was able to come to the [<i>DWTS</i>] tour and support as well.”</p><p class=p1>Slater and many of her fellow pro dancers toured the United States at the end of season 32. Umansky <a href=#>came to watch the live show</a> in March.</p><p class=p1>“It’s so nice to have Mauricio come and watch the<i> Dancing With the Stars </i>tour,” Slater gushed.</p><p class=p1>Slater and Umansky’s friendship sparked speculation from fans, who clocked their intense stage chemistry.
