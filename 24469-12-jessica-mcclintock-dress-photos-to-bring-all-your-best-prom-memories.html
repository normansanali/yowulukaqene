This certainly induced a lot of nostalgia around the Bustle office, with slightly embarrassing prom pictures being IM'd around the whole staff.</p><p>You, too, probably remember the stunning silk-and-ruche combinations that made up that perfect JM prom dress in the early aughts. No window was more eye catching at the mall come March (or earlier, if you were a little prom-sessed) than the one with all her tea-length, spaghetti-strapped gowns on display.</p><p>What are kids even doing these days, if there's no McClintock to come to the rescue? Buying <a href=# class=T3D>super sexy prom dresses</a> for starters. And probably feeling a strange, hollow sense of longing they can't quite place.</p><p>So, in honor of The Best Night Of Your High School Career, '90s nostalgia, everyone's obsession with posting pictures of themselves from the past, and, of course, our gone-but-never-forgotten favorite purveyor of prom dresses, I took to Twitter to gather some amazing Jessica McClintock photos from Bustle readers and editors. Everyone really stepped up to the challenge — sending in everything from the kind of gorgeous to the simply cringe-worthy. Thanks for the memories, JM.</p><h3>Little Black Ruching</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Bustle's Social Editor <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hayley</a> quite possibly wins "Most Jessica McClintock Dress" for this sassy little number. Digging the modest knee length, as well as the oversized corsage.</p><h3>Poof Party</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>My intern <a href=# class=T3D>Olivia</a> (on the right) really killed it in this one-shoulder, JM gown. Well done having your hair swept over the opposite shoulder, girl.</p><h3>The JM Maxi</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>While knee-lengths were definitely a McClintock trope, reader <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Sinead</a> proved that her maxis were just as amazing.</p><h3>Red and Strapless</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Reader<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> Kaitlin </a>explained, "I thought very old Hollywood, and my boyfriend wore a top hat and tails. With a cane. We were doing a whole Thing." I think you look like a vision in scarlet, Kaitlin.</p><h3>All That Glitters</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Can you spot the McClintock in this sea of dresses?</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>That's right, its the sparkly gold one covered in ruffles! Way to rock those retro curls, <a href=# class=T3D>Christine</a>.</p><h3>Seafoam Sauciness</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Dude. Mad kudos to reader <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Jaclyn</a> (second from right) for finding eye shadow the <i>exact same color</i> as her embroidered JM number.</p><h3>The Sweetest Thing</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>McClintock dresses weren't just for prom night! They dressed us for all sorts of teenage rites of passage — like reader <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Jordan</a> (right) at her Sweet 16.</p><h3>Pink Pizzazz</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>A JM gown that wasn't black, white, or red?! <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Alex</a>, one of Bustle's own, really knew how to pick a standout winner.</p><h3>Wild Thing</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Oh. My. God. Reader <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Kristin</a>'s zebra McClintock is quite possibly the most perfect thing I've ever seen.</p><h3>Limo Looker</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Well, well, well. It appears reader <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Anna</a> had quite the swaggy prom night, all "renting a limo" and what have you. Of course, no movie-ready prom would have been complete without a red McClintock dress.</p><h3>Royal Navy</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>This is actually quite tame for a JM gown! Reader Becky's dark blue dress is still made from that signature McClintock silkiness, but without all the standard ruffles and frills.</p><h3>'70s Babe</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p>Woah. I was actually floored when Hayley's mom, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Susan</a>, passed along her seriously stunning McClintock moment (that's her in the header photo, too) from her junior prom in 1978. "I was a junior dating a senior, whose face I blocked out to protect the innocent," she said. "That was one ugly light blue/dark blue tux. Dig the ruffled shirt." Me too.</p><p>(By the way, I still want to see your awesome Jessica McClintock dresses.
