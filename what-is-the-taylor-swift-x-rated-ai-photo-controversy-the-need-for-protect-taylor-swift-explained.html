As we know, AI websites creating such deepfakes just need a text prompt to make such photos and zero consent from the very real person they are portraying in their clearly problematic creation.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>A couple of X accounts, which posted the said images that went viral, have been suspended. And the few that remained or tried to jump on the glaringly problematic use of AI were immediately buried by the ever-present and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently loyal army of Swifties</a>.</p><h2 id=h-swifties-demand-action-as-they-rise-to-protect-taylor-swift data-injectable=false>Swifties demand action as they rise to ‚ÄúProtect Taylor Swift‚Äù</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>those taylor ai pics are straight up sexual harassment and it‚Äôs disgusting that man can do those things without repercussions. they see women as objects made for their sick fantasies and i‚Äôm so sick of it. it makes me want to throw up</p><p>PROTECT TAYLOR SWIFT <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HhUOZnVXp2</a></p>‚Äî ludovica ‡≠®‡≠ß (@sgfgludovica) <a href=#>January 25, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>In the last 24 hours the photos have spent being circulated on Twitter, the major and reigning response has been overwhelming from supporters and fans of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Folklore singer</a>. Though Taylor hasn‚Äôt addressed this disappointing usage of a technology that was supposed to be this groundbreaking revolution, the better part of the population has made it clear that a) those reveling in the revolting application of AI are far and few and b) they will not be tolerated and will be openly pointed out as the creeps they are.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>PROTECT TAYLOR SWIFT !!!! i hope she sues tbh, but that's one account down !!! if anyone sees other pages reposting those "taylor swift ai" images or creating new ones, please lmk so we can send the brigade over to mass report üôè <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xqvKIzovT1</a></p>‚Äî chelsea ü´ßüêô (@_wwmhd_) <a href=#>January 25, 2024</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>please report these accounts & all their posts üôè PROTECT TAYLOR SWIFT !!! @/AnaAnaaa556927 @/danielmarven @/ver0bin @/HashishPouf @/MrPlMPN @/emonsharkar99 @/Sheesh1218466 @/Lmaoletzgo @/heyjamesx</p>‚Äî chelsea ü´ßüêô (@_wwmhd_) <a href=#>January 25, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>While it is exceptional to see the united front Swifties and non-Swifties have put forward to stomp down the graphic AI photos and to defend the singer against those justifying the images by saying Taylor is a ‚Äúwhite billionaire,‚Äù it is beyond disheartening to acknowledge why it is being needed. There is no sugar-coating this ‚Äî creating non-consensual images of a person using AI is sexual harassment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>just because 'shes a white billionaire' doesn't mean that it's okay to make ai nudes of her and circulate them.

When it comes to a celebrity like Taylor, their legion of fans is quick to decipher what is real and what is fake, but what about someone who is not famous? Someone like you and me? What is stopping anyone from using the technology, which is not at all monitored or kept in check, which allows not just imagination but the most vile ideas to gain life-like presentation to dehumanize and humiliate an unsuspecting individual?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaSdsm7AwLKjqKpdqMSqstNmr2aqkamypXnAomSpoJ%2BpvG6vzqerq6emmr%2B0xYytn55lnpqypXnFqKlmqKKkwaav02armrGcpL9uv9aina1lla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
