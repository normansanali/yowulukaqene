Some&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelor</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;stars had more luck in the love department outside the reality dating series, finding forever without the prying eyes of cameras.</p><p><a href=#><strong>DeAnna Pappas</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Juan Pablo Galavis</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ali Fedotowsky</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Emily Maynard</strong></a> are among the former leads who broke up with their final picks, only to find The One after starring on the show.</p><p>Fedotowsky, for one, opened up exclusively to&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in July 2019 about her intentions for signing on to the ABC hit. “I went on the show for a good time. I didn’t go on for love. <a href=#>Nobody goes on the show for love</a> and then they’re just surprised when they actually do fall in love,” she admitted. “They go on there like, ‘This could be fun.’”</p><p>The reality star went on to confess that her motives would be a bit different if she starred on the series in this era. “If I went on the show right now, I [would] 100 percent be thinking Instagram followers. … I think to not think that way is kinda dumb,” she revealed. “Like … That’s gotta be in the back of your mind. … I’m an entrepreneur, I have an entrepreneurial type way of thinking.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Maynard, for her part, does not have particularly fond memories of her time in the franchise. “I always say I should not give anyone any&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;and&nbsp;Bachelorette&nbsp;advice because <a href=#>it has been kind of a train wreck</a>, to be quite honest,” she said during a January 2017 appearance on&nbsp;<a href=#>Good Morning America</a>. “My time on the show was a bit of a mess.”</p><p>However, everything is not necessarily smooth sailing for post-show relationships either. Pappas, who wed <strong>Stephen Stagliano</strong> in 2012, <a href=#>endorsed couples counseling</a> in August 2016. “It forced us to work through our marriage,” she told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;at the time. “This is it, me and him. There is no giving up, no turning back.”</p><p>Scroll to discover which Bachelor Nation alums found love after reality TV heartbreak.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXrqS0xKWmq2WSlrCpscuoqZ6spJp6tMDAq6pmr5ikeqe71KebZqSfq7JurcWtnKtlo528uHnPoaatp6Nkt6a%2F0p5kqZmcorKzeZJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
