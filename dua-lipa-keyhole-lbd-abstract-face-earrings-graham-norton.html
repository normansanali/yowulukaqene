For her latest engagement, the pop sensation let her earrings do the talking.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The “Training Season” songstress appeared on The Graham Norton Show on Friday alongside Cate Blanchett, Kate Winslet, Adrian Lester, and Justin Timberlake. For the star-studded occasion, Lipa made black the cheeriest color, looking radiant in an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.schiaparelli.com/eshop/en/e-shop/ready-to-wear/dresses-and-skirts/long-keyhole-dress/p/ro00416045_999-t34 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="elegant short-sleeved column gown" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>elegant short-sleeved column gown</u></a> in the inky hue, pulled from Schiaparelli’s Fall/Winter 2023–24 ready-to-wear collection. The piece featured a sultry keyhole cutout extending from her neckline down to mid-torso, and was surrounded by fluid draping details with extra gathered fabric flowing down the center of the dress, and a floor-grazing skirt that pooled around her in a circular train, completely covering her shoes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The stars of the ensemble, however, were Lipa’s massive gilded drop earrings, which depicted a stylistic, abstract image of a face, for a gorgeous artistic accent. The gold jewelry, also by the fashion house, featured brilliant diamonds for the eyes, which dazzled as they caught the light. Styled by Lorenzo Posocco, Lipa finished off the look with two gold rings. Makeup artist Sam Visser glammed up the singer-actor-model up with a glowy look, complete with a rosy blush, glossy nude lips, and dramatic black winged eyeliner, while hairstylist Rio Sreedharan slicked Lipa’s iconic fiery tresses back into a neat, middle-parted bun.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dressed for the part, Lipa dazzled on the British comedy talk show, as Norton highlighted the “Houdini” singer’s 18 no. 1 singles and 40 billion streams. She went on to discuss her worldly childhood; she was born and raised in London before moving to Kosovo at 11 years old, and then returning to the English capital by herself at 15.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I wanted to do music, and as much as I loved living in Kosovo, it was a very different experience,” she said on the program. “Now, everything has changed so much with streaming, and you can be anywhere in the world and your music can be heard. I didn’t feel that at the time. When I was living in Kosovo, there were so many artists that I wanted to see that wouldn’t come there in concert. I just felt like I wanted to come back to a place where there was so much more opportunity.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a relatable moment, Lipa talked about moving back to London with an older roommate, saying, “We got on for the most part until she went in my room and took pictures of my messy bedroom and sent it to my mum. Horrible! I was 15.” Celebrities really are just like us.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d41b366c-0c5e-4fd4-85f9-ab612540d1c4_1701099318.png alt="Headshot of Christina Perrier" title="Headshot of Christina Perrier" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Christina Perrier is a NYC-based freelance writer who covers culture and lifestyle topics.
