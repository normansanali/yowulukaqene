I just prefaced everybody to not say anything.</p><p>“In all seriousness there are two schools of thought on this because obviously Chris knows that he does not have the power to officially ban me from watching the cable broadcast that are beamed into my own home, but there’s two schools of thought.”</p><p>Jim thinks that one school of thought could be the theory that Brian Last promoted in that Jericho could be deflecting from his current controversy of playing live in from of the unmasked masses in Sturgis and throwing the heat Cornette’s way.</p><p>A second way Cornette looks at it is that Jericho’s going for the ratings. He says it could be because he was trying to promote his match with Orange Cassidy.</p><p>“‘If rattle Jim Cornette’s followers, if I rattle that cage, they’ll watch it. Not only will Cornette watch it but they’ll watch it just to get even with me, just to stick it back in my face,’ so he’s trying to promote his match with ‘Little Dog Pockets.'”</p><p>You can check out the full clip of Cornette’s take below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZByb2pwY2K3qrmMnKarppWpwaZ5wqGpoqtdn7KztcKhpqxlkZrEbq7Apw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
