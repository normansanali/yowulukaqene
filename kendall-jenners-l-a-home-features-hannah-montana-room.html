Inside the property, Jenner entertains her friends, <a href=#>cooks frequently</a>, meditates and follows in the footsteps of her famous sisters — particularly <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> — by displaying her magazine covers through the years.</p><p>“I like a house that has character. When I walked into this place, I was immediately drawn to the peaceful Spanish-y, farmhouse-y vibe,” she told the magazine. “My life involves a lot of chaos and travel and high energy, so I wanted a home that feels serene, a place where I can simply zone out and relax.”</p><p>For Jenner, “me” time includes painting in her converted art studio and watching&nbsp;<a href=#>The Bachelor</a>&nbsp;with <a href=#>her pals</a>. “I’m not a huge party person. There aren’t a lot of ragers going on here,” she explained. “I like turning on music, lighting the fireplace and candles, and watching NBA games with my friends.”</p><p></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>&nbsp;star turned to her siblings — Kim, 39, <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> — as well as mother <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> for décor ideas. “<a href=#><strong>Kylie [Jenner]</strong></a> and I were super lucky to have guidance from our older sisters and a mom who really has her s—t together,” she said. “They all gave me solid advice on how to set up my kitchen and bath for maximum efficiency. They also taught me that a house is always a work in progress.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On that note, Kendall reflected on how she put her personal flair into the house with help from designers <strong>Kathleen Clements</strong>, <strong>Tommy Clements</strong> and <strong>Waldo Fernandez</strong>. “I’m really proud of what we accomplished here. This is the first home I’ve done completely, and I think it’s a genuine reflection of who I am and what I like,” she concluded. “In the end, I’m still a young female in L.A., just trying to have some fun.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more photos of Kendall’s A-list worthy home, which includes a piece that brother-in-law <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a> inspired her to get!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuKa6w5qjpWWamruvsdGsZKVlkWK1sLnEZp2emaSqv6a%2FjKGYp6aRnXquu82tmKeZXae8sLmO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
