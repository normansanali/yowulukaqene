Her Barbadian mother is named Helen whereas her Nigerian father is called Dele.</p><p>Find out about their age, job, and current residence in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Ayo Edebiri Parents?</strong></h3><p>According to reports, Ayo Edebiri was born to a Nigerian father and a Barbadian mother. For her performance in The Bear, Ayo won an Emmy at the 75th Annual Emmy Awards in January 2024. However, the humorous performer has gained popularity since deciding to study dramatic writing at NYU and launch her writing career. Ayo acknowledged her parents, who were in attendance at the Emmys, during her address.</p><p>Despite being born and raised in Boston, Ayo’s parents are immigrants. Her father traveled from Nigeria, while her mother immigrated to the United States from Barbados. (Ayo stated in 2023 to The New Yorker that she would rather not have her parents’ identities mentioned due to an earlier harassment episode.) Ayo grew up going to Pentecostal church twice a week with her family. Her father isn’t religious, but her mother is.</p><p>Ayo baited The New Yorker, saying, “I was like, ‘You’re going to Hell, bro.'” Despite this, Ayo’s religious upbringing gave rise to dreams about the Rapture and the fear that her mom was sent to Heaven and Ayo and her dad were left behind when she wasn’t in bed.</p><p>Ayo got along well with her parents, who have always been supportive, despite their differences in religion. “My parents are very practical people and they told me, ‘If this comedy thing is an actual career and a job that you want, then you have to treat it like that,’” she told&nbsp;Forbes.</p><p>They had initially encouraged her to pursue a teaching degree, but they were still in favor of her changing her major as long as she took it seriously.</p><p>To offer their support, Ayo’s parents went with her to the 75th Emmy Awards. Ayo did, however, acknowledge that she wasn’t seated among them in her award speech.</p><p>“This is a show about found family and real family, and my parents are here tonight,” Ayo said in her speech. “I’m making them sit kind of far away from me because I’m a bad kid. But I love you so much. Thank you so much for loving me and letting me feel beautiful and Black and proud of all of that. I just love you so much.”</p><h3><strong>Ayo Edebiri Barbadian Mother Helen</strong></h3><p>Ayo Edebiri’s Barbadian mother is likely named Helen Edebiri. <span class=html-render>Edebiri’s mother works with special education students. </span>Born in 1959, Helen is 64 as of 2024.</p><p>In 2019, she shared a snapshot of their chat about Keannu Reeves that hinted at her name. “My mom is hot and keeps me up to date on the trades! Above all? She’s hot! John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum comes out this Saturday ❤️.” Ayo’s caption read.</p><p>Considering her mother’s food, Ayo will likely still want to return home frequently. She said her mother is “a really, really incredible cook” in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 2022. Maybe Ayo used some of her mother’s culinary skills for her part in The Bear.</p><h3><strong>Ayo Edebiri Nigerian Father Dele Edebiri</strong></h3><p>Ayo Edebiri was born to her Nigerian father Iyekoretin Dele Edebiri. In November 2023, Dele is 62 years of age. He <span class=html-render>works in state government.</span></p><p><span class=html-render>Per one LinkedIn, he was a manager at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He began his career there in September 1990.</span></p><p>On Father’s Day 2020, Ayo wished her dad, “happy father’s day to my favorite heroic African. I stole my personality from him and that is the tea!!!!”</p><p>Ayo told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Derby</a> in 2023, “My dad loves TV and movies, but there’s definitely an element of, ‘What did you do for a long time?’ And now it’s very comforting that they know what I do. They’re like, ‘Just to confirm, you won’t be moving back? You’re done? You’re good?’”</p><p><strong style=font-style:normal;color:var(--theme-color-text_dark);font-family:Lora,serif;font-size:24px;letter-spacing:-.03em>Related FAQs</strong></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Do Ayo Edebiri Parents Reside?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ayo Edebiri’s parents reside in Dorchester, Massachusetts.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>How Many Kids Do Ayo Edebiri Parents Have?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Ayo Edebiri is the only child of Helen and Dele Edebiri.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Are Ayo Edebiri Parents Still Married?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Indeed, Ayo Edebiri’s parents are still married.</p>Total 0 Shares <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-facebook"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Share</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-twitter"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Tweet</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a> <a href=# class=pk-share-buttons-link><i class="pk-share-buttons-icon pk-icon pk-icon-pinterest"></i> <span class="pk-share-buttons-label pk-font-primary">Pin it</span> <span class="pk-share-buttons-count pk-font-secondary">0</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmmrGfYrKlscGiqaJloJa%2FprrTrGShnZyau26xw56ZoqqZYq6vsIydnKWdXZqxpq7Iq6Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
