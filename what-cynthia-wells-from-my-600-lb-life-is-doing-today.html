As Cynthia said on her 2018 "My 600-lb Life: Where Are They Now" episode (via&nbsp;<a href=#>Heavy</a>), her extreme weight already prevented her from being as involved in their lives as she'd like. "I want to be out there with my kids, that's what a parent is supposed to do," Cynthia said. "I see that I'm harming them as much as I'm harming me because I'm not letting them live to their full potential."&nbsp;She'd been unable to attend her daughter Ukiah's dance performances.</p><p>While she made a good start, ending her first "My 600-lb Life" episode at 454 pounds after her gastric sleeve surgery, Cynthia continued to lose weight, even returning to Dr. Now for his help. She agreed to see a therapist, as that was the only way Dr. Now would agree to keep working with her, per&nbsp;<a href=#>Distractify</a>. She lost another 100 pounds or so, and at the end of her follow-up episode, she weighed 360 pounds.</p><p>Cynthia is active on <a href=#>her Facebook page</a>, and in April, <a href=#>posted</a> that she'd been ill with COVID-19. But the schoolteacher had frequently posted updates about her fitness, continuing to work on her weight loss, and enjoys time with her children. We hope she recovers from the virus quickly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlibYR6e9ahmK1lk667tbTImmSwnZyhwG6y0aikZqWpYoNxfIylmWakmZuybrXSZpuooZ6cerW7w5qwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
