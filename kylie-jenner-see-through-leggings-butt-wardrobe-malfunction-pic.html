The&nbsp;18-year-old ensured all eyes were on her when she stepped out wearing a&nbsp;skintight unitard as her boyfriend <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tyga</a></strong>, 25, was seen dropping her off at Cedars-Sinai Hospital on Nov. 6. Unfortunately for Kylie,&nbsp;the racy look did little to cover up her bare butt, which was on full display as she made her way into the hospital.&nbsp;Keeping the focus on her figure, Kylie finished the look with a black bomber jacket, white Nike high-top sneakers and a green Chanel shoulder bag.</p><h3></h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>Kylie joined <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Khloe Kardashian</a></strong> and the rest of her famous sisters at Lamar’s intimate 36th birthday party, which was held inside a private room at the hospital. The family was reportedly joined by several of Lamar’s closest friends, who were invited by Khloe to spend a couple of hours with Lamar on his special day,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reports.&nbsp;“Everyone’s in great spirits, mainly Lamar,” a source told <strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong> EXCLUSIVELY. “The overwhelming love and support Khloe and her family have shown him is incredibly phenomenal. He’s never been happier. He’s thanked each and everyone of them for their love and support. He’s truly grateful.”<br><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=hollywoocom-20&l=pf4&o=1" alt width=1 height=1 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=p1>Unfortunately for Kylie,&nbsp;things took a negative turn after leaving the hospital when she and Tyga hit up In N’ Out Burger for a quick bite. The young reality star became annoyed when she discovered a female paparazzo was waiting outside the restaurant to snag a photo of her. Being the social media queen that she is, Kylie made sure to document the encounter on Snapchat, in which <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she could be heard calling the photographer a&nbsp;a”bitch”</a> before saying, “no woman should be a paparazzi.” Fans did not take kindly to the video, and were quick to call out Kylie for her hypocritical and highly sexiest comments.
