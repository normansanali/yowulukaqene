These trainers are specifically in the front of the gym, on the side of the gym, and the trainer near the sandwich shop. Once these trainers have been defeated in battle they'll point you in the direction of several NPC who'll give the player hints for what the secret menu item is.</p><p>The clues are found with various NPCs and in certain locations around the town. You'll want to talk to a regular at the bar, read the ice cream stand menu, go to the Amphitheater, and talk to a Medali resident in the gym to get these clues. The hints themselves are fairly obvious, but for players looking to breeze through the gym and not solve the puzzle themselves, the answer is as follows:</p><ul><li>Grilled Rice Balls</li><li>Fire Blast (extra crispy)</li><li>Serving Size: Medium</li><li>With Lemon</li></ul><p>And that's it. After players order the secret menu item, the regular at the bar who gave one of the hints will enter the gym, revealing himself to be Larry, the Normal-type gym leader. Larry comes into the fight with three fairly beefy Normal-type Pokémon, so players should be ready for a fight.</p><p>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet are now available for the Nintendo Switch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyiqmasmJp6tLHCq5ytZZSewKl5z6iinqWfo3q0r8Cro56sXau2sLjErQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
