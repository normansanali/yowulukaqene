Though the show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had its flaws</a>, it pleased its fans throughout its impressive run. The cast of the show has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">changed a lot</a> over the years, and there are plenty of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shows to watch</a> for those that miss this series being on the air.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of the cool things about popular shows is that fans can often times spot moments where the shows influences come into play. Because people have seen </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> so many times, fans have noticed plenty of things, including a distinct </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> influence. While the series is not in a galaxy far, far away, it does have some interesting connections to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, how do these two franchises intersect? Let’s take a look and see!</span></p><h2 id=the-charmed-episode-in-question>The Charmed Episode In Question</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3B73CA78-5310-4BA8-8AEA-0C960930DCDD.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>In order to see where the interesting connection between </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> comes from, it is important to go back to the episode in question. This, of course, is going to give us the biggest shred of evidence linking the two franchises together.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in season 6 during episode 12 of the series, fans noticed an incredible connection that linked </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. During the episode, there is a lot going on with the sisters, especially Piper. According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fandom</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, Paige and Phoebe need to conjure Mr. Right to talk some sense into her.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Elsewhere in the episode, the girls and the fans alike are privy to certain information from the Order. It is during their time on screen that the Leader drops a line that many people were able to recognize fairly quickly.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>When speaking to a member of the Order, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Leader says</a>, “I find your lack of faith disturbing.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Impressively, this was not the only pop culture reference that was used in the same episode. According to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Fandom</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, the episode's title itself, “Prince Charmed”, is a direct nod to the infamous Prince Charming from fairy tale lore.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>This quote was a nice reference to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, but for many fans of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, there was some confusion as the where exactly this line came from.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Character Did Al Pacino Almost Play In Star Wars?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-star-wars-connection>The Star Wars Connection</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9F583FAD-7589-4347-A3D2-10803E96E9C3.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now that we have the episode of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> locked down, we need to hope in the Millennium Falcon and zip off to another galaxy to see how this lines up with </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. After all, a connection needs two parts for it to work.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For many fans of the saga, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>A New Hope</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> remains one of the best films in the franchise. It was the one that started it all back in the 70s, and it introduced the world to iconic character and moments that have been able to stand the test of time and inspire millions of people around the world.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Naturally, this movie’s ability to inspire people has come in many ways, including some truly iconic lines. It is from this film that </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> borrowed some serious inspiration for a line used by the Leader of the Order.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>During the iconic scene, Darth Vader flexis his powers for the people in the room and the audience at home, as he uses the Force to choke Admiral Motti.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As he is using his power, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vader tells the Admiral</a>, “I find your lack of faith disturbing.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Now, instead of using something similar to this line, the folks at </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were more than happy to directly quote the iconic moment, which pleased fans of both franchises. Amazingly, this would not be the only time that </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>would borrow from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy’s Role In ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’ Helped Him Build His $30 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=another-star-wars-influence>Another Star Wars Influence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9D4F91E6-77EE-43DB-8CCA-8BFE9D963A89.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>The connection between </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> thanks to the Vader line is undeniable, but this is not the only time that the show has taken influence from the saga. In fact, one of the biggest influences that it took was from the makeup and costume department.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As one of the most infamous villains in all of Star Wars, Darth Maul is as recognizable as any other character in the franchise. He has a distinct red and black look and is completely menacing when he is on screen. Clearly, people were happy to use him as a source of inspiration moving forward.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The character Belthazor from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> could not look any more like Darth Maul, and this is a connection that people have made for some time. While the two characters have a ton of differences, there is simply no way of denying how similar they look.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Both characters wound up having an impact in their respective franchises, but overall, Darth Maul is far more popular. </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Phantom Menace</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> was a massive success, and to this day, Maul has popped up in other projects in the franchise.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Charmed’ Reboot: Everything We Know So Far</a></span></p><p><i><span style=font-weight:400>Charmed</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> and </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Star Wars</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> don’t have a lot in common, but these connections are undeniable.
