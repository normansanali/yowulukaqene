She’s everything to me. She [has] only become more of everything since filming ended,” Dotun gushed. “I’ve never been more certain about anything in my life. I want to keep rocking and keep moving.”</p><p>Charity accepted a proposal from Dotun during Monday’s episode after sending<strong> Aaron Bryant </strong>and<strong> Joey Graziadei</strong> home. At AFR, Dotun admitted that he went into proposal day with “mixed feelings” because he didn’t know where she stood with Joey.</p><p>“To know that your life is going to change the matter with the outcome is was really heavy,” he said. “I went into it really heavy, unsure. I don’t know what other relationships are like. I don’t want to expect anything. … So [I] went into it with a serious face, game face because I really wanted this girl and luckily it worked out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Charity-Lawson-and-Fiance-Duton-Olubeko-After-the-Final-Rose-2.jpg><p>When it comes to wedding plans, Charity noted: “It will be sooner rather than later. We don’t have a set date or anything. … We’re just enjoying the season of life.”</p><p>In addition to giving the twosome a trip to Greece, ABC had Dotun tell his fiancée that she will be competing on <a href=#>season 32 of </a><a href=#>Dancing With the Stars.&nbsp;</a></p><p>“The future just could not be brighter for the two of you!” <a href=#><strong>Jesse Palmer</strong></a> exclaimed.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Charity previously confirmed to Us Weekly that <a href=#>she didn’t just fall for one</a> contestant during production. “It definitely is possible [to be in love with more than one person] considering circumstances and how much time we have to really just, like, truly focus on these connections,” she said in June. “It is definitely possible [and] something I actually did not think was gonna ever happen.”</p><p>If Charity and Dotun make it down the aisle, they will be the first Bachelorette couple to say “I do” in several seasons. Season 12 Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>JoJo Fletcher</strong></a> and season 13 Bachelorette <a href=#><strong>Rachel Lindsay </strong></a>are the last leads to marry their winners, tying the knot with <a href=#><strong>Jordan Rodgers</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Bryan Abasolo</strong></a>, respectively.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJifrJWnerW0xGadoqaRoXqzu9KeZKudk5a9bq%2FHmqmirKlirq%2BwjJ2mra2eYryvedaem52hnpx6sbjAp6po</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JBlogX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
