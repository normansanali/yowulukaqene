She is a blonde bombshell with a sense of humor and a heart of gold. She is also making MAFS UK&nbsp;history as the first transgender contestant on the show.</p><p>“This experiment is so much more than just me getting married,” Ella explained in her bio. “I see this as a big deal for someone who has transitioned.”</p><p>Ella already has a significant relationship because she lives with her Nan. She described them as “the dynamic duo everyone needs in their life” as she explains their close relationship.</p><p>Ella entrusted her faith in Mel,&nbsp;Paul,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Charlene to find her perfect match. The experts put Ella and Nathanial together, and while their wedding day was ideal, their honeymoon demonstrated that their love is destined to be everything but straightforward. Since the beginning of the show’s run, Nathanial and Ella have both commented on each episode. The groom even suggested that Married At First Sight was “scripted,” to which the network has since responded.</p><p>During the first dinner party, Ella revealed herself to her co-stars in a touching speech. Ella explained, “When I was born, I appeared very different from how I do today. My mum gave birth to four boys, three brothers, and then me. My mom asked me when I was younger if I was gay, and I said, ‘No Mom, I am a woman.’ She said, ‘You want to be a girl?’ I said, ‘No. I am a girl.”</p><p>She added, “I’ve never questioned who I am. I’ve always known I’m Ella inside. We all have struggles in life. Most people just never have to question their identity or their gender. I don’t expect you guys to understand or get me. All I ask is that you respect me and treat me as the person I am. I’m not ashamed to stand here as an openly transgender woman, where there’s so much negative stigma about trans people.”</p><p>Ella explained, “Now that my outside – and it’s a very sexy outside – matches my inside, I stand in front of you all as an openly trans woman, but more importantly, I stand here is Ella and all I want to do is be seen and treated as the girl that I am, finally.”</p><p>Nathanial knew ahead of doing the show, that Ella was a transgender lady. Ella says she took part because in the past she’s felt fetishized “or a dirty secret and I know I’m so much more than that”.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">“No one’s ever really fully accepted me,” she tells BBC Newsbeat. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>“I thought it would get easier once I’d had my surgery. </span><span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>Unfortunately, it was not any easier. There’s still this stigma and this embarrassment of dating someone who’s transitioned.”</span></p><p>There were rumors Ella’s fiancé was unaware she was trans when they first met at the altar when it was revealed she would be on the show.</p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">“Because it was the first time Channel 4 had ever done something like this, I agreed along with them that once they’d found me a match my husband was made aware that I was trans prior to the wedding,” Ella explained. <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>“He was aware that I was trans and I had transitioned but he didn’t know anything else about me.”</span></p><p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10">Sadly, Ella recently disclosed that she had to stop using social media because of the transphobic remarks she had been subjected to as a result of being featured on the program.</p><p data-beyondwords-marker=fd8ab456-fef3-42d9-b7ad-7dda9489e8a4>aking to her Instagram Stories, Morgan said: “I know I’ve been a bit absent today. I’ve just found it a little bit hard and I’m going to be real with you guys, so I’ve just taken a step back. But I just want to say thank you because all your messages have got me through everything.”</p><p data-beyondwords-marker=fd8ab456-fef3-42d9-b7ad-7dda9489e8a4>She added, “I don’t always read the comments anymore because of the transphobia. I can take it, I’m resilient to it. I’ve heard it enough times by now. But it’s not fair on my family, who didn’t ask for all of this but they still want to support me.”</p><h3><strong>MAFS UK 2023: Are Ella Morgan Clark And Nathanial Still Together?</strong></h3><p>All the drama that arose after Ella Morgan and Nathanial Valention’s meeting suggests that they are no longer together. However, they have remained tight-lipped to confirm their relationship status.</p><p>After Ella and Nathanial clicked right away, everything started to go south over their honeymoon. Nathanial shared that he knew he was set up with a transgender woman on the show and he was not okay with it.</p><p>Since there was little physical contact between them, Ella claimed she felt uneasy and worried that Nathaniel was not attracted to her. On the E4 show, Nathaniel alleged that Ella was acting up for the cameras, which sparked an exchange of insults. The groom has since come forward, alleging that the producers set him up and that he was forced to quit the show due to his deteriorating mental condition.</p><p>Nathaniel told Mirror: “My only deal-breakers were that she didn’t smoke and didn’t work in the sex industry.”</p><p>Ella reportedly does smoke and, after they wed, told Nathanial that she had worked as a stripper.</p><p>Nathanial went on: “There are couples with a beautiful connection. But with Ella, the show created a monster. I didn’t know who I was marrying. Some of the welfare just wasn’t there. What happened to me can’t happen to another person. This show needs to have a ‘For Entertainment Purposes’ all over it.”</p><p>Nathaniel also asserted that “The Story,” a production company, was at fault. He told the publication, “That was the kind of manipulation that went on.”</p><p>In a statement addressing the allegations, Channel 4 said: “Nathanial entered this process voluntarily with full and informed consent and was provided with more information than we would ordinarily share, to make him aware that his bride was trans.”</p><p class=paragraph-text>Channel 4 concluded, “The matching process entails a detailed interrogation of participant’s preferences and none of these would be overlooked when deciding who to pair them with. The welfare of all contributors is our top priority and we ensure support is available before, during and after filming – including 24/7 access to welfare or psych support. The show is an unscripted reality series which follows real events as they naturally unfold and is in no way scripted.”</p><h3><strong>Ella Morgan Clark Before Surgery</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAFS-Ella-Morgan-Before-Surgery-300x252.jpg><h3><strong>Ella Morgan Clark Age</strong></h3><p>1993 is Ella Morgan’s birth year.

And she found her dad and three brothers could not have been more ­positive when she broke the news.</p><p>Ella said: “I felt sure mum and dad would think they’d lost a child, that they’d somehow failed, and I was ­robbing them of the chance of having grandchildren. But every single one of my family made me feel happier and more confident than I’ve ever felt before.”</p><p>Chris recalled, “She had a big, dark wig on, she was wearing a dress and had full make-up on.
