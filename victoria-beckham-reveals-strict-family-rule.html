So I love going to work. But with the kids, both myself and David are really hands-on,” Beckham explained to the magazine. “Yes, I’m up early working out but one of us will do the school run and we always try to be home by dinnertime. We’re very strict about that when we’re in London—at 6 p.m. we are all together, eating dinner, talking about our days.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The designer and mother of four even opened up and reflected on her days as a Spice Girl in the February cover story. Her other four former bandmates—Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell, and Melanie Chisholm—completed a Spice Girl reunion world tour last year, though Beckham did not take part.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I learnt an enormous amount being very young and very, very famous. You realize it’s much more difficult to maintain success than it is to actually achieve it—and it’s not as glamorous as people would think,” said Beckham. “I look back and smile about the Spice Girls now—I’m so proud of everything we achieved. It was about making people embrace who they are, being happy with who they are, being the best version of themselves and for that to be celebrated,” reminisced Beckham.<br></p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/4daa8765-4788-452b-b976-683922ffb919_1660573271.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" title="Headshot of Bianca Betancourt" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Bianca Betancourt is the culture editor at <a href=# rel=noopener>HarpersBAZAAR.com</a>, where she covers all things film, TV, music, and more.
